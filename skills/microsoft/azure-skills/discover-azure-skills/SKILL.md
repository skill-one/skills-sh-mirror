Follow these steps to discover the available azure skill matching the given task description.

1. List plugins

List Azure plugin directories from the GitHub Contents API: https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/azure-skills/contents/.github/plugins?ref=main

In the result, each entry whose `type` is `dir` is a plugin directory. Skills are organized by plugins.

2. List skills

For each plugin, list their skills from the GitHub Contents API: https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/azure-skills/contents/.github/plugins/{plugin-dirname}/skills?ref=main

In the result, each entry whose `type` is `dir` is a skill directory. Each skill has a SKILL.md file that explains what this skill should be used for.

3. Discover relevant skills

Eliminate the skills that obviously aren't relevant by their names. Then for each remaining skill, read their description from the API: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/azure-skills/main/.github/plugins/{plugin-dirname}/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md

Use the descriptions to further eliminate skills that aren't relevant.

4. Discover the plugin name of the relevant skills

For each relevant skill, discover their plugin name by reading the `plugin.json` from the GitHub Contents API: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/azure-skills/main/.github/plugins/{plugin-dirname}/.plugin/plugin.json

This is important because a plugin's name may be different from its directory name. The installation commands depend on the plugin's name.

5. Report the matched skills

Report the matched skills and offer instructions to install them. Skills can be installed by installing their plugin. Read the installation instructions matching the agent client to offer the installation instructions.
