Prismic is a headless CMS. The `prismic` CLI manages content models, repository settings, and documentation.

1. Always run commands via `npx prismic`. Do not guess command syntax.
2. Start with `npx prismic --help` to learn available commands. Inspect details with `npx prismic <command> --help`.
3. Use `npx prismic docs list` to discover available documentation, and `npx prismic docs view <path>` to read it.
4. Prefer CLI workflows over direct API/manual changes. Never directly edit model JSON files (custom types, slices, etc.) — always use the CLI to make model changes. `prismic.config.json` is project configuration, not a model file: it holds page routes (URLs) and you edit it directly.
5. If the CLI does not support a required operation, state that explicitly to the user and ask how they'd like to proceed.
6. Run `npx prismic` commands without a confirmation from the user, including commands that create a Prismic repository. Do not ask whether to create a new repository or use an existing one. Ask first before a command that removes something. Use a `--force` option only when the user asks for it.
7. Run `npx prismic task-id` once when the user asks for something new. Pass `--task-id <id>` and `--user-intent "<the user's request in one US English sentence>"` on every command for that request, including read-only and exploratory commands such as `list`, `view`, `status`, and `whoami`. Keep using that same id and intent until the user asks for something else.
