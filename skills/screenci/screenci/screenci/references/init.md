# `npm init screenci`

Use `npm init screenci -- --yes` to scaffold a new ScreenCI project without prompts.

## Commands

```bash
npm init screenci -- --yes
npm init screenci "My Project" -- --yes
npm init screenci "My Project" -- --verbose
```

## What It Creates

`npm init screenci -- --yes` creates a ready-to-run project in the current directory containing:

```text
screenci.config.ts
recordings/
  example.screenci.ts                  # base video (logo intro overlay)
  example-screenshot.screenci.ts       # cropped still of one element
  assets/logo.png
package.json
tsconfig.json
README.md
.gitignore
.github/workflows/screenci.yaml (optional)
```

No overlay component is scaffolded: overlays take their colours from the recorded app (see [overlays.md](overlays.md)), so the first one is written per project as `recordings/assets/theme.ts` plus a component. Under `--no-react`, `.tsx` overlays are unavailable and overlays are plain `.html` pages that carry the same values as a `:root` variables block. The generated `.gitignore` ignores only binary media under `recordings/assets/` (image, video, and audio files); HTML, TSX, and SVG overlay sources there stay committed.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ required

## Notes

- `init` can be run at any time, but it is non-destructive and will not re-initialize an existing project. If the project is already initialized (a `screenci/` directory already exists), it fails on purpose and exits with an error like `screenci/ already exists`. That is expected. Do not delete the existing project to force a re-init: continue working with the project that is already there.
- No account or setup token is needed. `preview` (see below) uploads under a local, anonymous trial session with no connection step at all; `export` needs an account with an active paid plan.
- A setup code from the web app (`SC-XXXX-XXXX`, see the Quick Start in SKILL.md) replaces `init` entirely: `npx screenci@latest setup <code>` uses, pulls, or scaffolds the project workspace and writes its credentials.
- If the user already has a `SCREENCI_SECRET` from an existing account, pass it as init's first positional argument and init writes it into `screenci/.env`, so recordings upload straight to their organization instead of an anonymous trial.
- Prefer `--yes` for non-interactive setup. Without it, the command prompts for setup choices and defaults the project name to the current directory name when none is provided. A positional that looks like a `SCREENCI_SECRET` is treated as the secret, not the project name.
- The name is used as the ScreenCI project display name. Files are always created in the current directory.
- `--yes` accepts the defaults.
- `--agent <name>` is passed to the selected skills install command.
- `--verbose` shows more setup output.
- `preview` uses local Playwright and uploads with or without `SCREENCI_SECRET` set; `export` requires one.

## Typical Flow

```bash
npm init screenci@latest -- --yes  # scaffold, no account needed
npx screenci test                  # verify the video works
npx screenci preview "<title>"     # record the free live preview and print the link
npx screenci export                # only when the finished videos are wanted (account required)
```
