# Infrastructure Resources Skill

Use this skill to discover and inspect **infrastructure resources** — what exists, whether it
is healthy, and what its raw data contains.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose | Key flags |
|---|---|---|
| `cx infra resources types` | List available resource types (category/type pairs) | - |
| `cx infra resources list` | List resources of one category/type | `--category`, `--type` (required); `--name-filter`, `--scope key=value`, `--start-row`, `--end-row` |
| `cx infra resources health-history <resource-id>` | Daily health samples for one resource, oldest first | - |
| `cx infra resources raw-data <resource-id>` | Raw resource document as JSON | - |

- All commands are **read-only** and support `-o json` / `-o toon` for
  structured output.
- **Multi-profile fan-out applies to `types` and `list` only.** Repeat
  `-p <profile>` on those to compare fleets across accounts. `health-history` and
  `raw-data` take a resource id, which is scoped to one team, so they **reject**
  more than one `-p` — run them once per profile instead.
- `--scope` is repeatable across **different** keys; allowed keys are `service`,
  `environment`, `team` (e.g. `--scope environment=prod --scope service=checkout`).
  Multiple keys combine with **AND** — a resource must match all of them. Each key
  accepts a single value and may be given **at most once**; repeating one (e.g.
  `--scope service=a --scope service=b`) is rejected. To cover several values for one key, run one query per
  value and combine the results.
- Pagination: `--start-row` / `--end-row` define a row window (`--end-row` is
  **exclusive**); the default is the first 100 rows, and omitting only `--end-row`
  gives 100 rows from `--start-row`. Page through large fleets in windows
  (0-100, 100-200, …). **`list` never pages for you** — fleets can run to hundreds
  of thousands of resources, so it returns one window and reports the total.
- **The window cannot reach past row 10,000.** The API rejects any request whose
  `start-row + rows` exceeds 10,000, so paging cannot enumerate a fleet larger
  than that even though `total_count` reports its true size. In any case,
  narrow with `--name-filter` or `--scope` and page within each subset rather
  than trying to walk the whole list.
- `list` wraps its rows in an envelope (`total_count`, `returned_count`,
  `resources`) — the other subcommands return bare arrays. `total_count` is the
  fleet-wide match count, always present and independent of the window, so use it
  as the stop condition: keep paging while `start_row + returned_count <
  total_count`, subject to the 10,000-row ceiling above.
- Pass resource IDs **exactly as returned by `list`** (quote them — they contain
  `:` and `=`); the CLI percent-encodes them for you.

## Inspection Workflow

Three steps, and only because each one supplies an input the next one requires:
`types` gives the mandatory `--category`/`--type`, `list` gives the `resource_id`.
Answering "is `web-server-1` healthy?" is these three calls — nothing more.

1. **Discover what exists** — categories and types are dynamic, so never guess:

   ```bash
   cx infra resources types -o json
   ```

2. **List resources** of that category/type, narrowing with name and scope filters:

   ```bash
   cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances \
     --name-filter web --scope environment=prod -o json
   ```

3. **Inspect one resource** using a `resource_id` from step 2. Statuses are
   `Healthy`, `Critical`, or `Unmonitored`, one sample per day, oldest first:

   ```bash
   cx infra resources health-history "1001234:host_id=i-abc123" -o json
   ```

   `raw-data` is the **alternative** to this step, not a follow-on — use it
   instead when you need source-specific detail rather than health.

## Examples

### Just the ids and names

```bash
# Rows live under .resources — `list` returns an envelope
cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances -o json \
  | jq '[.resources[] | {resource_id, name}]'
```

### Check fleet size, and whether one window covered it

```bash
cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances -o json \
  | jq '{total_count, returned_count}'

# Next window, if there is one
cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances \
  --start-row 100 --end-row 200 -o json
```

### Find when a resource went critical

```bash
# health-history returns a bare array, so no .resources here
cx infra resources health-history "1001234:host_id=i-abc123" -o json \
  | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "Critical")]'
```

### Read the raw resource document

```bash
# Source-specific detail: tags, instance metadata, configuration
cx infra resources raw-data "1001234:host_id=i-abc123" -o json
```

## Key Principles

- **Discover before listing** — `--category` and `--type` are required;
  always start from `cx infra resources types`.
- **Quote resource IDs and pass them verbatim** — they embed `:`, `|`, and `=`;
  the CLI handles URL encoding.
- **Scope keys are a fixed set** (`service`, `environment`, `team`) — unknown
  keys are rejected client-side before any request is made.
- **A missing raw document is not an error** — `raw-data` exits 0 and emits an
  *empty result* on **stdout**: `[]` in `json`, `[0]:` in `agents`, and
  `No raw data found.` in text. Only the note `no raw data for this resource` goes
  to stderr. Parse the empty stdout result as a cleanly absent document, not a
  failure — and do not expect stdout to be blank.
- **Use `-o json` with `jq`** for filtering; use `-o toon` for token-efficient
  output in agent contexts.
- **Multi-profile fan-out is for `types` and `list` only** — repeating
  `-p <profile>` tags each row with its profile so fleets can be compared across
  accounts. The row window applies per profile, so `list` adds a
  `counts_by_profile` breakdown — page each profile against its own `total_count`,
  not the aggregate. `health-history` and `raw-data` error on a second `-p`.
- **A resource id never crosses profiles** — it embeds the team id
  (`1001234:host_id=…`), so an id from one account cannot resolve in another. When
  a multi-profile `list` turns up something worth inspecting, note its `profile`
  field and query that single profile for its health or raw data.
- **Infra health is its own concept** — the `Healthy`/`Critical`/`Unmonitored`
  statuses are computed by the infrastructure domain and are not the same as
  Service Catalog health. Correlate them with telemetry signals;
  do not treat them as interchangeable.
- **`resource_id` never leaves this skill** — pass it only to `health-history`
  and `raw-data`. For every other command, pivot on the resource `name` or the
  `service` scope value.

## Related Skills

Bridge to these skills using the resource **name** or the **service** scope
value — never the resource id, which only this skill understands:

- **`cx-telemetry-querying`** — `cx search-fields "<name>" -s value` discovers
  which log/span fields contain the resource name; `cx logs "filter
  $l.subsystemname == '<service>'"` queries the service's telemetry. Correlate a
  `Critical` health day with error logs or CPU metrics.
- **`cx-alerts`** — `cx alerts list --name "<name-or-service>"` finds alert
  definitions matching the resource or its service by substring.
- **`cx-dashboards`** — `cx dashboards search "<name-or-service> ..."` and
  `cx dashboards query-search --description "..."` find dashboards semantically;
  pair with `search-fields -s value` to then `query-search --field` the exact
  field holding the resource name.
