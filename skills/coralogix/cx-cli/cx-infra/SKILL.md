# Infrastructure Resources Skill

Use this skill to discover and inspect **infrastructure resources** — what exists, whether it
is healthy, and what its raw data contains.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose | Key flags |
|---|---|---|
| `cx infra resources types` | List available resource types (category/type pairs) | - |
| `cx infra resources list` | List resources, narrowed by any filterable attribute | all optional: `--match-all NAME=VALUE`, `--match-any NAME=VALUE`, `--category`, `--type`, `--start-row`, `--end-row` |
| `cx infra resources filters` | List the attributes resources can be filtered by, with their accepted values | `--category`, `--type` |
| `cx infra resources health-history <resource-id>` | Daily health samples for one resource, oldest first | - |
| `cx infra resources raw-data <resource-id>` | Raw resource document as JSON | - |

- All commands are **read-only** and support `-o json` / `-o toon` for
  structured output.
- **Multi-profile fan-out applies to `types`, `filters` and `list` only.** Repeat
  `-p <profile>` on those to compare fleets across accounts. `health-history` and
  `raw-data` take a resource id, which is scoped to one team, so they **reject**
  more than one `-p` — run them once per profile instead.
- **Filtering takes two flags.** Every `--match-all` must match; at least one
  `--match-any` must match; the two groups combine with **AND**. So
  `--match-all OS=linux --match-any Health=Critical --match-any Region=eu-west-1`
  means `OS=linux AND (Health=Critical OR Region=eu-west-1)`.
- **A comma lists several values for one attribute, and the flag decides what
  that means.** In `--match-any` they are alternatives — any one matches:
  `--match-any Region=eu-west-1,us-east-2`. In `--match-all` every one must
  match, which is how to narrow on two substrings at once:
  `--match-all 'Name=*alert*,*processing*'` finds the names holding both. An
  attribute that carries a single value cannot equal two of them, so for
  **either value**, reach for `--match-any`.
- **An attribute belongs to exactly one flag.** Repeating it within a flag, or
  naming it in both, is refused — list its values after the comma instead.
- **Nothing is required except one narrowing input.** `--category` and `--type`
  are ordinary filters, not prerequisites, so `--match-all Health=Critical` alone
  works. A request naming none of `--match-all`, `--match-any`, `--category` or
  `--type` is rejected.
- **`Category` and `Type` are not filterable attributes.** They select which
  resource types a request covers, have their own flags, and never appear in
  `filters` output — so there is no `--match-all Category=Hosts`, use
  `--category Hosts`.
- **An exact value is case-sensitive; a wildcard one is not.** `OS=linux` matches
  and `OS=Linux` returns nothing, but `Name=*checkout*` and `Name=*Checkout*` are
  the same query. `filters` lists values only for a fixed set, so for free text
  either take the spelling from a row's `columns` or use a wildcard. A `status`
  value is matched case-insensitively either way.
- **0 rows is an answer, not a failure.** A valid attribute that is simply
  unpopulated matches nothing; do not retry or reword the query. A misspelled
  attribute or an out-of-set value is rejected outright, naming what is accepted.
- **`filters` tells you three things per attribute.** `kind` is what the value
  looks like — `string` means free text, `status` means a fixed set, and `number`,
  `bool` and `date` mean themselves. `values` lists the accepted values of a fixed
  set — pass one of those, spelled as `filters` reports it. `wildcard` says whether
  a `*` is accepted in the value — only `string` attributes accept one, and it
  matches anywhere in the value: `--match-all 'Name=*checkout*'` — quote it, or the
  shell expands the `*`.
- **`--name-filter` and `--scope` are the legacy flags and stand apart.** Both
  require `--category` and `--type`, and neither can be combined with
  `--match-all` or `--match-any`. Use `--scope` to narrow by `service`,
  `environment` or `team`; use the filter flags for everything else —
  `--match-all 'Name=*web*'` is the same query as `--name-filter web`.
- Pagination: `--start-row` / `--end-row` define a row window (`--end-row` is
  **exclusive**); the default is the first 100 rows, and omitting only `--end-row`
  gives 100 rows from `--start-row`. Page through large fleets in windows
  (0-100, 100-200, …). **`list` never pages for you** — fleets can run to hundreds
  of thousands of resources, so it returns one window and reports the total.
- **The window cannot reach past row 10,000.** The API rejects any request whose
  `start-row + rows` exceeds 10,000, so paging cannot enumerate a fleet larger
  than that even though `total_count` reports its true size. In any case,
  narrow until the result fits — add `--match-all` attributes, or a `--type` — and
  page within each subset rather than trying to walk the whole list.
- `list` wraps its rows in an envelope (`total_count`, `returned_count`,
  `resources`) — the other subcommands return bare arrays. `total_count` is the
  fleet-wide match count, independent of the window. Check it before reasoning
  over the rows: keep paging while `start_row + returned_count < total_count`, and
  if it exceeds what you can page to, narrow the query rather than trusting a
  partial answer.
- Pass resource IDs **exactly as returned by `list`** (quote them — they contain
  `:` and `=`); the CLI percent-encodes them for you.

## Inspection Workflow

Three steps, and only because each one supplies an input the next one requires:
`filters` gives the attribute names and their accepted values, `list` gives the
`resource_id`. Answering "is `web-server-1` healthy?" is these three calls —
nothing more.

1. **Discover what can be filtered** — attribute names and their accepted values
   are per resource type and dynamic, so never guess. Omit both flags for the
   union across every type:

   ```bash
   cx infra resources filters -o json
   ```

   `cx infra resources types -o json` lists the `(category, type)` pairs, when
   you need those rather than the attributes.

2. **List resources**, narrowing by any attribute `filters` offered:

   ```bash
   cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances \
     --match-all Health=Critical -o json
   ```

3. **Inspect one resource** using a `resource_id` from step 2. Statuses are
   `Healthy`, `Critical`, or `Unmonitored`, one sample per day, oldest first:

   ```bash
   cx infra resources health-history "1001234:host_id=i-abc123" -o json
   ```

   `raw-data` is the **alternative** to this step, not a follow-on — use it
   instead when you need source-specific detail rather than health.

## Examples

### Unhealthy hosts in one region

```bash
# Health is a fixed set, so `filters` first for the accepted values
cx infra resources filters --category Hosts -o json | jq '.[] | select(.name == "Health")'

cx infra resources list --category Hosts \
  --match-all Health=Critical --match-all Region=eu-west-1 -o json \
  | jq '.resources[] | {name, type}'
```

### Every resource whose name contains a substring

```bash
# `filters` reports wildcard: true for Name, so `*` is accepted
cx infra resources list --match-all 'Name=*checkout*' -o json \
  | jq '.resources[] | {name, category, type}'
```

### Either of two attributes, any resource type

```bash
# --match-any ORs across attributes; no category or type needed
cx infra resources list \
  --match-any Name=coredns --match-any Namespace=kube-system -o json \
  | jq '.resources[] | {name, category, type}'

# Two values of the *same* attribute take the comma form, not a second flag
cx infra resources list --match-any Namespace=kube-system,observability -o json

# The same comma in --match-all requires *all* the values: names holding both
cx infra resources list --match-all 'Name=*alert*,*processing*' -o json
```

### Just the ids and names

```bash
# Rows live under .resources — `list` returns an envelope
cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances -o json \
  | jq '[.resources[] | {resource_id, name}]'
```

### Check fleet size, and whether one window covered it

```bash
cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances -o json \
  | jq '{total_count, returned_count}'

# Next window, if there is one
cx infra resources list --category Hosts --type EC2_Instances \
  --start-row 100 --end-row 200 -o json
```

### Find when a resource went critical

```bash
# health-history returns a bare array, so no .resources here
cx infra resources health-history "1001234:host_id=i-abc123" -o json \
  | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "Critical")]'
```

### Read the raw resource document

```bash
# Source-specific detail: tags, instance metadata, configuration
cx infra resources raw-data "1001234:host_id=i-abc123" -o json
```

## Key Principles

- **Discover before filtering** — never guess an attribute name or a status
  value; start from `cx infra resources filters`, which lists both.
- **Quote resource IDs and pass them verbatim** — they embed `:`, `|`, and `=`;
  the CLI handles URL encoding.
- **A missing raw document is not an error** — `raw-data` exits 0 and emits an
  *empty result* on **stdout**: `[]` in `json`, `[0]:` in `agents`, and
  `No raw data found.` in text. Only the note `no raw data for this resource` goes
  to stderr. Parse the empty stdout result as a cleanly absent document, not a
  failure — and do not expect stdout to be blank.
- **Use `-o json` with `jq`** for filtering; use `-o toon` for token-efficient
  output in agent contexts.
- **The row window applies per profile** — a multi-profile `list` adds a
  `counts_by_profile` breakdown, so page each profile against its own
  `total_count`, not the aggregate.
- **A resource id never crosses profiles** — it embeds the team id
  (`1001234:host_id=…`), so an id from one account cannot resolve in another. When
  a multi-profile `list` turns up something worth inspecting, note its `profile`
  field and query that single profile for its health or raw data.
- **Infra health is its own concept** — the `Healthy`/`Critical`/`Unmonitored`
  statuses are computed by the infrastructure domain and are not the same as
  Service Catalog health. Correlate them with telemetry signals;
  do not treat them as interchangeable.
- **`resource_id` never leaves this skill** — pass it only to `health-history`
  and `raw-data`. For every other command, pivot on the resource `name` or the
  `Service` attribute value.

## Related Skills

Bridge to these skills using the resource **name** or the **Service** attribute
value — never the resource id, which only this skill understands:

- **`cx-telemetry-querying`** — `cx search-fields "<name>" -s value` discovers
  which log/span fields contain the resource name; `cx logs "filter
  $l.subsystemname == '<service>'"` queries the service's telemetry. Correlate a
  `Critical` health day with error logs or CPU metrics.
- **`cx-alerts`** — `cx alerts list --name "<name-or-service>"` finds alert
  definitions matching the resource or its service by substring.
- **`cx-dashboards`** — `cx dashboards search "<name-or-service> ..."` and
  `cx dashboards query-search --description "..."` find dashboards semantically;
  pair with `search-fields -s value` to then `query-search --field` the exact
  field holding the resource name.
