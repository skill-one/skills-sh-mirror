# Voice Modality Reference

## Overview

Voice agents use the `modality voice:` block to configure text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) behavior. This block is optional — omit it for text-only agents.

Voice agents also require:
- The standard `agent_type` (e.g. `AgentforceServiceAgent`) — **do NOT** set `Atlas__VoiceAgent` in the bundle `config` block. `Atlas__VoiceAgent` is a runtime `planner_type` value applied by the platform, not an authored field in the `.agent` file.
- A `VoiceCallId` linked variable bound to `@VoiceCall.Id` (the voice-channel session identifier — the voice analog of `@MessagingSession.Id`).
- A `language:` block with the appropriate locale.
- A voice-capable connection surface — `connection customer_web_client:` (ECv2). `connection messaging:` is **additive**, needed only for human escalation (see "Connection Blocks" below).

### VoiceCallId variable

Add this to the `variables:` block whenever `modality voice:` is present:

```agentscript
    VoiceCallId: linked string
        source: @VoiceCall.Id
        description: "This variable may also be referred to as Voice Call Id"
```

## Agent Script Syntax

```agentscript
modality voice:
    voice_id: "UgBBYS2sOqTuMpoF3BR0"
    outbound_speed: 1
    outbound_stability: 0.65
    outbound_similarity: 0.75
```

## Default Voice — start here

There is **no reliable CLI/API way to enumerate available voice IDs** and their tuning values, so ADLC always authors the platform default voice and lets the user customize afterward in the UI. Do **not** ask the user to supply a `voice_id`.

| Field | Default value |
|-------|---------------|
| `voice_id` | `UgBBYS2sOqTuMpoF3BR0` ("Mark") |
| `outbound_speed` | `1` |
| `outbound_stability` | `0.65` |
| `outbound_similarity` | `0.75` |
| locale | `en_US` |

These match the platform default (`Eleven_Flash_V2_5` model config `outboundVoice` parameter).

**Tell the user how to customize:** after the agent is created, open it in **Agent Builder → Connections → Voice** and click **Continue** to pick a different voice and tune speed/stability/similarity. The picklist of voices (with names, gender, accent, and locale) is only exposed in that UI — not via the CLI.

The `modality voice:` block is a top-level optional block, placed after `language:` and before `start_agent`:

```agentscript
system:
config:
variables:
connection:
knowledge:
language:
modality voice:
start_agent:
subagent:
```

## Voice-Specific Authoring Guidance

### Instructions for Voice Agents

Voice interactions differ from text. When authoring instructions for voice agents:

1. **Keep responses concise.** Users cannot scan/skim voice responses. Aim for 1-2 sentences per turn, not paragraphs. (Long turns also risk tripping the silence/nudge timer — see [voice-latency-heuristics.md](voice-latency-heuristics.md) §5.)
2. **Avoid lists longer than 3 items — and batch long ones.** Users lose track of spoken lists. For a list that can be long, read at most **2 items per turn** and offer to continue (*"Would you like the next two?"*) rather than reading the whole set. **Never speak a raw total count** ("I found forty-seven results") — it's meaningless aloud; summarize or offer to narrow instead.
3. **Use confirmation patterns — and split capture from action.** Repeat back key information (account numbers, dates, amounts) before taking action. For anything that triggers an irreversible action (sending an email/SMS, creating a record), make **capture and send two separate steps**: capture and store the value, read it back, get a yes, and only *then* call the action that acts on it. Don't let a single turn both collect a misheard value and act on it.
4. **Design for barge-in.** Users may interrupt. Instructions should handle partial inputs gracefully. Add: *"If the caller starts talking, stop speaking immediately, listen, and respond to what they said — don't finish your sentence."*
5. **Avoid formatting references.** Do not reference links, bullet points, tables, or visual formatting in instructions — they don't render in voice.
6. **Acknowledge slow actions — prefer the platform's progress indicator over LLM filler.** Any action over ~800ms (SOQL, external HTTP, retrieval) needs a "still working" signal. **Best practice:** set a `progress_indicator_message` on the action itself (*"Just a moment while I look that up"*) so the platform speaks the hold phrase and the agent's own turn begins **with the answer** — don't have the LLM vocalize "one moment" as well, or the caller hears it twice. Reserve LLM-spoken filler (*"Let me pull that up"*) for cases where you can't set a progress message. Mark truly instant actions out of the progress indicator so they don't announce a delay that isn't there. This is the instruction-level fix for the latency patterns in [voice-latency-heuristics.md](voice-latency-heuristics.md).
7. **Render numbers, prices, and IDs in spoken form.** TTS reads `$19.99` and `+14155551212` as garble. Instruct: *"When reading numbers, prices, phone numbers, IDs, or dates, use natural spoken form — never read punctuation, currency symbols, or raw digits."* Spell out numbers under 100 ("twenty-five"); prices as *"nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents"*; phone numbers digit-by-digit grouped naturally; dates as *"May tenth, twenty twenty-six"*. Author this guidance **once** — do not stack extra rules or tag overrides trying to force phone-number grouping, country-code suppression, or a specific date format. Those are platform-controlled; see "Entity Confirmation & Normalization" below.
8. **Add ASR repair prompts for misheard input.** Speech recognition isn't perfect. Instruct: *"If the caller's response doesn't match an expected value, or you're unsure what you heard, repeat it back and ask them to confirm — e.g. 'I heard four four two, is that right?'"*
9. **Give empty results a caller-friendly fallback.** Any lookup that can return zero results needs a graceful recovery. Instruct: *"If a lookup returns nothing, don't say 'no records found.' Say something like 'I couldn't find that account — could you spell your last name?' or offer a different search."* (Pair with voice-friendly action error shapes — see [actions-reference.md](actions-reference.md) "Voice-Safe Action Authoring".)
10. **Never claim an action happened unless it did.** The most common voice failure mode is the agent saying *"I've sent that to you"* or *"you'll get a text shortly"* when no action actually fired. Instruct explicitly: *"Never state or imply that an email, SMS, or record action has happened, is happening, or will happen unless you actually executed the corresponding action this turn."* Confirm delivery only *after* the action returns success.
11. **Never expose internals to the caller.** Action names, variable names, JSON, tool inputs, and retriever/knowledge-source names must never be spoken aloud. Instruct: *"When invoking an action, say only the configured progress message or the final customer-facing answer — never read out action names, field names, or raw data structures."*

### Entity Confirmation & Normalization — what you CANNOT control from instructions

How spoken entities are **read back and confirmed** (phone numbers, currency, dates, numerals, IDs) is decided by the platform's voice normalization layer, **downstream of your agent instructions**. A few specific behaviors are **not** reliably controllable from the `.agent` file — and trying to control them makes things *worse*, not better:

- **Country code on phone numbers** (e.g. a "plus one" prepended to a US number). Whether it appears is decided by the normalization layer, not your prompt.
- **Digit grouping when reading numbers back** (e.g. `980 23 222 45` vs. an even digit-by-digit read). Grouping is applied at the language level and can vary run-to-run.
- **Dropping the current year from a date** (e.g. reading a same-year date as month and day only).

**Do NOT author custom instructions or tag overrides to fight these.** Adding rules like "always emit the phone tag with an empty country code," "read phone numbers as area-code / prefix / last-four," or "always include the year" **conflicts with the platform's built-in tagging and makes readback *less* consistent, not more.** In practice these overrides produce unreliable, ~50/50 results and can destabilize otherwise-correct normalization.

**What to do instead:**
- Write the spoken-form guidance in item 7 **once**, and stop there. Tag entities correctly (say the value is a phone number, a price, a date) and let the platform normalize it.
- If a customer needs a specific readback format or wants to **suppress an out-of-the-box confirmation**, that is **platform/product configuration, not agent-script authoring**. Per-entity confirmation configurability is active platform work — surface the requirement to the voice product team rather than encoding a workaround in the `.agent` file.
- Set the customer's expectations: these three behaviors may still occur regardless of instructions, and are being addressed at the platform layer.

### Instruction Example — Voice vs Text

**Text agent instruction:**
```agentscript
| Here are your options:
  1. Check order status
  2. Return an item
  3. Speak with a representative
  Please enter the number of your choice.
```

**Voice agent instruction:**
```agentscript
| Ask the customer what they'd like help with. You can check order status, process a return, or connect them with a representative. If unclear, ask one clarifying question.
```

### Connection Blocks — how `modality` and `connection` relate

`connection` blocks are separate from `modality voice:`. **`modality voice:` configures voice *behavior*** (TTS voice, speed, STT tuning); **`connection` blocks declare the *surface/channel*** the agent is wired to. A voice agent needs both: the modality block for how it speaks, and a voice-capable connection surface for where it runs.

There is **no `connection voice:` surface type** — do not invent one. In Agent Script, the voice-capable connection surface is **`connection customer_web_client:`**, which corresponds to **Enhanced Chat v2 (ECv2)** in Agent Builder (see Agent Builder → Connections). This is the surface that makes Agent Builder **Preview** and voice work:

```agentscript
connection customer_web_client:
    adaptive_response_allowed: True
```

**Is `connection messaging:` also required?** No — it is **additive, not required for voice**. Add `connection messaging:` only if the agent escalates to a human (`@utils.escalate`); escalation is routed through it. If the agent has no human-escalation path, `customer_web_client` alone is sufficient. Most service voice agents *do* escalate, so both blocks commonly appear together (this is what the UI shows when both ECv2 and Messaging connections are enabled):

```agentscript
connection messaging:
    escalation_message: "Let me transfer you to a specialist who can help."

connection customer_web_client:
    adaptive_response_allowed: True
```

> **Choosing a surface — ECv2 (`customer_web_client`) vs Telephony.** Both ECv2 and Telephony (Service Cloud Voice) are voice-capable channels. In Agent Builder, adding *either* connection auto-enables Voice Settings. ADLC authors **`customer_web_client` (ECv2)** because it is the surface that is reliably created via the CLI/DSL today and is what Agent Builder Preview requires. If your deployment target is Service Cloud Voice telephony, author `customer_web_client` for authoring/preview, then complete the telephony channel wiring **headless via the CLI** — see [voice-telephony-cli.md](voice-telephony-cli.md) (`MessagingChannel` + routing flow + `Atlas__VoiceAgent` planner). It is *not* a UI-only step.
>
> **Do not** invent `connection voice:`, and do not remove an existing `connection messaging:` block when enabling voice — enabling voice **adds** the `modality voice:` block, the `VoiceCallId` variable, and `connection customer_web_client:`.

> **Note on the `telephony` connection type.** `actions-reference.md` lists `telephony` as an escalation-routing channel. That is a *routing* surface for the `connection` escalation block; for voice *authoring + preview* the DSL surface ADLC emits is `customer_web_client` (ECv2). See known-issues.md Issue 18 for why `CustomerWebClient` must sometimes be patched into the compiled `GenAiPlannerBundle` after publish.

## When to Add a Modality Block

| Scenario | Modality Block? |
|----------|----------------|
| Text-only agent (messaging, web chat) | No |
| Voice-only agent (telephony) | Yes — required |
| Multi-channel agent (text + voice) | Yes — voice channel uses it |
| Employee agent (internal, no customer channel) | No (employee agents are text-only) |

## Validation

The `modality voice:` block is validated during `sf agent validate`. Common issues:

- Invalid `voice_id` — must be a valid voice model ID from the org's voice provider
- Out-of-range floats — `outbound_speed` must be 0.5–2.0, others must be 0.0–1.0
- Timing values out of bounds — speak-up timers: 10s–5min, endpointing/beepboop: 0.5s–60s

## Telephony Channel Setup Is Headless (CLI) — No UI Step Required

You can **author**, **validate**, **publish**, AND **wire to a telephony channel** entirely
headless (CLI/API). `sf agent validate/publish authoring-bundle` compile and deploy the agent
metadata (including the `modality voice:` block); the last-mile telephony/voice channel
attachment — creating the `MessagingChannel`, wiring the routing flow, and going Live on a
phone number — is done with `sf data create record`, `sf project deploy`, and `sf api request
rest`. See **[voice-telephony-cli.md](voice-telephony-cli.md)** for the full procedure.

> **Correction to prior guidance.** Earlier versions of this doc treated voice-channel deploy as
> UI-only (open Agent Builder → Connections → Voice → Continue). That is **no longer accurate** —
> the same channel wiring is fully scriptable via the CLI (proven by the Contact Center
> `afv-pstn-setup-cli` skill: "fully headless, no browser"). Do **not** tell the user the channel
> step requires the UI.

The **one** thing that still needs the UI is picking a **non-default voice ID / tuning** — the
voice picklist (names, gender, accent, locale) is not enumerable via CLI, so ADLC authors the
platform default voice and the user customizes later in Agent Builder → Connections → Voice
(see "Default Voice — start here" above). This is a voice-*selection* limitation, not a
channel-*attachment* one.

Headless telephony wiring, in brief (full detail + gotchas in
[voice-telephony-cli.md](voice-telephony-cli.md)):
1. Planner: `plannerType=Atlas__VoiceAgent` + a `SurfaceAction__Telephony` plannerSurface, with ≥1 topic.
2. Deploy escalation flow → voice queue (`RoutingModel=ExternalRouting`) → inbound routing flow (`routingType=Copilot`).
3. `MessagingChannel` (`MessageType=PstnVoice`, `MessagingPlatformKey=<phone>`), then PATCH `SessionHandlerId` (FlowDefinition `300…`) + `FallbackQueueId`.
4. Poll the phone number to `CodeStatus=Live`; smoke-test with a call.

## Steel Thread Alignment (Project Codey)

Voice work in ADLC targets **Steel Thread 2 — "Voice-Enabled Agent with Knowledge Grounding"**: build voice agents with subagents, actions, and knowledge integration (ADL / Salesforce Knowledge), then deploy to the voice channel. Two implications for authoring:

- **Pair voice with knowledge grounding.** Voice service agents are almost always FAQ/policy-backed, so `/agentforce-generate` proactively asks the Knowledge Grounding question when it detects a voice agent. The combined template is `assets/agents/voice-knowledge-grounded.agent`.
- **Deploy is now fully headless.** Authoring, validation, publish, AND telephony-channel wiring are all CLI — see [voice-telephony-cli.md](voice-telephony-cli.md). (Formerly a Steel Thread 2 gap; the channel step no longer requires the UI. Only non-default voice-ID selection remains UI-only.)
