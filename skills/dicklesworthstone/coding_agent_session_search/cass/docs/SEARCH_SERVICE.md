# Persistent lexical search over standard I/O

`cass serve` lets a coding agent or local coordinator keep one lexical reader
open across repeated searches instead of paying the full index-open cost for
one `cass search` process per query. It uses the production `SearchClient`
parser, scorer, source filtering, and result reducer. It does not implement a
second search engine.

```sh
cass serve --stdio --data-dir /path/to/cass-data
```

Alternatively, select a published lexical index directory directly:

```sh
cass serve --stdio --index /path/to/published-lexical-index
```

Exactly one explicit location and `--stdio` are required. `--data-dir` resolves
the index path using the compiled CASS schema version without creating any
folders. It does **not** open the canonical database. There is no implicit
selection of another user archive. Use `cass serve --help` for this command's
independent parser; it dispatches before ordinary CLI readiness/maintenance
setup, like the logical-archive command. Existing root introspection does not
yet enumerate this independent command.

## Lifecycle and snapshot contract

Starting the process, requesting status, or submitting an invalid query does
not load an index. The first valid search lazily opens it. Subsequent searches
reuse that same admitted lexical reader; query-prefix response caching and
background prewarming are disabled. Newly published indexing work is not
silently mixed into an existing session.

`reload` releases the old reader **before** opening its replacement, so this
operation never intentionally retains two multi-gigabyte reader generations.
If opening the replacement fails, the session is unloaded. It does not silently
fall back to the old reader. A later reload or valid search may retry the same
fixed path. Shutdown and end-of-input release the reader and terminate; there
are no detached children or network listeners.

`reader_epoch` is a monotonically increasing **session-local** successful-open
counter, not a canonical database generation, checksum, or freshness proof.
Responses explicitly report `snapshot_policy: "pinned_until_reload"` and
`freshness: "not_checked"`. Status means only whether this process has a loaded
reader, not whether the archive is complete, current, or healthy.

Search returns **index previews**, not canonical message bodies. It
never supplies a database path to `SearchClient`, loads semantic models,
rebuilds indexes, initiates automatic refresh, or downloads assets. Keep
indexing in a separately managed maintenance process. To validate or inspect
a hit against the canonical archive, retain its `source_id`,
`conversation_id`, and `message_index` for the ordinary CASS follow-up commands.
`message_index` is one-based canonical message addressing, **not a raw file
line number**. Identity fields are never shortened to fit an output budget.
For complete bounded bodies in the same service, opt in to `view` using the
fixed `--db` configuration described below. No archive is inferred from `--data-dir`.
Candidate-only neural reranking is separately enabled by `--reranker-model`;
ordinary `search` remains lexical and does not load or invoke the model.

## Wire protocol, version 1

Send one UTF-8 JSON object per line; each request gets one JSON response line.
Flush after sending. There are no unsolicited stdout messages. Requests are
processed sequentially, so backpressure does not create an in-process request
queue. Without `--mcp`, this is a CASS JSON-lines protocol, not JSON-RPC.
The MCP adapter described below uses the same reader and bounds.

Every request requires an unsigned 64-bit `id`. Five operations are always available:

```json
{"op":"status","id":1}
{"op":"search","id":2,"query":"performance","limit":10,"offset":0,"filters":{"agents":["codex"],"workspaces":["/my/project"],"source_id":"work-laptop"}}
{"op":"reload","id":3}
{"op":"unload","id":4}
{"op":"shutdown","id":5}
```

Search defaults to `limit: 10`, `offset: 0`, and no filters. `filters` may contain
`agents`, `workspaces`, `source_id`, `created_from`, and `created_to`; timestamps
are integer Unix milliseconds and bounds are inclusive according to the
existing lexical engine. `source_id` is always one exact ID: strings such as
`remote` and `all` are **not** special groups here. To search every source,
omit that field. Empty agent/workspace lists mean unrestricted.

Unsupported fields and operations are errors, never silently ignored. There
is no `mode`, semantic fallback, session-path filter, arbitrary per-request
index path, full-content search, or maintenance operation. Canonical `view` is
separately enabled by `--db`. In particular,
post-filter routes that can expand to corpus-sized candidate windows are not
exposed as bounded service filters.

A response has `schema_version`, `id`, `ok`, and either `result` or `error`.
Malformed requests use `id: null`. A failed request does not terminate the
session except on transport failure, an oversized frame, or a process deadline.
Ordinary request errors retain their
cause in `error.message`; callers should branch on the stable `error.kind`.

Search results contain `hits`, `count`, `limit`, `offset`, `reader_reused`,
`setup_ms`, `search_ms`, `preview_only`, and the session `snapshot` metadata.
Hits preserve source, conversation, one-based message, agent, workspace,
timestamp, origin and score fields. Titles are limited to 256 characters and
snippets to 800 characters, on Unicode character boundaries. No `content`
field is returned.

Pagination probes for one extra hit. `has_more: true` means an extra hit was
actually observed. When another same-sized page is within the service budget,
`next_offset` supplies its offset. With no observed extra hit, both fields are
`null`: bounded candidate selection does not prove that the complete corpus is
exhausted. There is no exact-total-count claim.

When another same-sized page would exceed the service's page window,
`next_offset` is null and `page_window_exhausted` is true, even if an extra hit
was observed. Narrow the query or filters rather than following an invalid
continuation offset.

## Bounds and limitations

Request frames are limited to 64 KiB excluding the newline; responses are
limited to 1 MiB including JSON escaping and the newline. An oversized request
gets one error and closes the session without draining an unlimited suffix.
An oversized response is replaced with a small error before any of its bytes
are published; it is not truncated into an apparently successful result.

Queries must be nonempty and at most 4,096 UTF-8 bytes. Limits must be 1–100,
and `offset + limit + 1` must not exceed 1,024. Each agent/workspace filter has
at most 32 values. Individual filter and returned identity strings are limited
to 4,096 UTF-8 bytes. Invalid budgets are refused before the reader is loaded.

These are transport and candidate-window bounds, not kernel allocation limits.
Resident-memory supervision below adds a sampled termination threshold.
The first index admission can still be expensive. Each independently started worker still owns
its own reader: reuse one process rather than spawning one for each query.
Global vector/HNSW serving is not implemented by this endpoint. Opt-in
`refine` scores only a bounded lexical shortlist. Optional shared reader
admission below bounds owners, not total RSS.

### Enforced request deadlines

Both transports default to a **30,000-ms whole-request deadline**. Set
`--request-timeout-ms 5000` for a five-second budget, or explicitly allow a
longer cold open. Accepted values are 1–300,000 ms; zero cannot disable the
guard. Status reports the configured deadline and termination exit code.

The deadline starts when the worker first observes any byte of a new frame and
covers the rest of input framing, decoding, native index admission/query or
canonical lookup or opt-in model loading/inference, result encoding, and output flushing. A partial line and a
client that stops reading responses are therefore bounded too. Waiting for
the first byte of the next request is idle time and is deliberately excluded.
Completing a request joins its watchdog before another request can be admitted;
an old timer cannot terminate an unrelated later query. Reader teardown on EOF
or transport failure is guarded separately with the same configured duration.

**Expiry terminates the entire read-only worker with exit code 124**, rather
than returning a soft timeout while native work continues in a detached thread.
There is no timeout JSON/tool-error response: producing one could itself block
on the stalled output pipe. Discard an incomplete final line, observe process
exit, and restart/reinitialize before retrying. Earlier complete responses stay
valid. The new process starts a new session-local reader epoch; do not equate
epochs across processes. Failure of the watchdog itself exits with code 125.

Termination does not wait for Rust destructors or flush evidence buffers.
Use this mechanism only on the service's read-only paths, never for indexing
or archive publication. The deadline itself does not impose a memory limit,
alter the native engine's cancellation API, or guarantee real-time OS scheduling under system
suspension/starvation. Hosts should still supervise the worker process and
enforce their own end-to-end deadlines, including startup and idle lifetime.

## Reusing one process from Python

```python
import json
import subprocess

with subprocess.Popen(
    ["cass", "serve", "--stdio", "--data-dir", "/path/to/cass-data"],
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    text=True,
    encoding="utf-8",
) as worker:
    def exchange(request):
        worker.stdin.write(json.dumps(request) + "\n")
        worker.stdin.flush()
        # Text-mode limit is a defensive client bound; the server enforces bytes.
        line = worker.stdout.readline(1024 * 1024 + 1)
        if not line or not line.endswith("\n"):
            raise RuntimeError("search worker closed or returned an invalid frame")
        response = json.loads(line)
        if response["id"] != request["id"] or not response["ok"]:
            raise RuntimeError(response)
        return response["result"]

    try:
        first = exchange({"op": "search", "id": 1, "query": "performance"})
        second = exchange({"op": "search", "id": 2, "query": "profiling"})
        assert second["reader_reused"]
        # Reload deliberately when the caller chooses to adopt a new publication.
        exchange({"op": "reload", "id": 3})
        exchange({"op": "shutdown", "id": 4})
    finally:
        worker.stdin.close()
        try:
            worker.wait(timeout=30)
        except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
            worker.kill()
            worker.wait()
```

The example waits synchronously for replies and will observe EOF if the worker
times out. Applications should additionally supervise startup and the exchange
against their own deadline; the worker timeout is a process-termination policy,
not resumable per-query cancellation.

Native regressions are in `tests/search_service.rs`, including the complete
production module's tests: real Quill reader reuse, source-scoped identities,
publication isolation, explicit/failed reload, no archive writes, frame bounds,
invalid-request recovery, pagination uncertainty, and actual binary dispatch.
Run `cargo test --locked --test search_service -- --test-threads=1` through the repository's normal
validation environment. Test definitions alone are not execution evidence.

## MCP integration

An MCP host can launch the same read-only worker directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cass": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/cass",
      "args": ["serve", "--stdio", "--mcp", "--data-dir", "/path/to/cass-data"]
    }
  }
}
```

The adapter implements the initialization-based MCP revisions **2025-11-25**
and **2025-06-18**. Send `initialize`, then `notifications/initialized`, before
calling `tools/list` or `tools/call`. Unsupported handshake versions are
counter-offered 2025-11-25. The newer stateless 2026-07-28 protocol is not
advertised: `server/discover` returns Method Not Found, allowing dual-era MCP
clients to fall back to the supported handshake. A modern-only client cannot
use this adapter. Protocol behavior follows the versioned MCP lifecycle and
stdio specifications, not an assumption that every version uses initialization.

The catalog exposes `cass_search`, `cass_status`, `cass_unload`, and `cass_reload`.
With an explicit startup `--db`, it also exposes the read-only `cass_view` tool.
With `--reranker-model`, it additionally exposes `cass_refine`, described below.
`cass_search` arguments are the JSON-lines search fields **without** `op` or
`id`; status, unload and reload accept an empty object. The JSON-RPC ID is preserved
exactly, including string and signed-integer IDs. There is no arbitrary file
reader, SQL tool, shell command, indexing tool, or semantic-mode substitution.
Tool results include both `structuredContent` and its JSON representation in
a text content block. Retrieval and budget failures are visible to the model
as `isError: true`; invalid RPC methods/envelopes remain protocol errors.

Initialization, discovery, and status do not load an index. Search and reload
share the exact same session handler as the CASS protocol; reader reuse,
release-before-reload, source coordinates, and unchecked-freshness metadata
are unchanged. All callers using one worker share its reader. An explicit
`cass_reload` affects that worker's subsequent queries, not another worker.
At most 120 valid tool invocations are admitted per minute per process; excess
calls get a nonblocking `rate_limited` tool error instead of a queued operation.

Notifications receive no response and cannot run a tool without a request ID.
There is no MCP shutdown RPC: close stdin, then terminate the process if its
external deadline expires. Requests are serial, so cancellation notifications
received after native work completes are ignored. This adapter does **not**
provide resumable per-call native cancellation, a global memory governor, HTTP, or
authentication over a network. Configure the host to approve access to the
selected history archive and treat returned session text as untrusted data.

MCP lifecycle, malformed-frame, ID, quota, real-reader/reload, and binary
handshake regressions run in the same `search_service` integration target.

## Canonical evidence follow-up (explicit opt-in)

Enable complete message reads from one fixed archive, independently of the
retained lexical reader:

```sh
cass serve --stdio --mcp --data-dir /path/to/cass-data --db /path/to/cass-data/agent_search.db
```

The `--db` option grants access only to that configured canonical archive.
Starting the process, initialization, discovery, status and lexical searches
still do not open it. No database path is accepted inside a request. Omitting
`--db` keeps the original index-only capability: `cass_view` is absent from the
MCP catalog and cannot be invoked by guessing its name. JSON-lines `view` then
returns `canonical_access_disabled`.

Without `--mcp`, send:

```json
{"op":"view","id":5,"source_path":"/history/session.jsonl","source_id":"local","conversation_id":42,"message_index":13,"context":1}
```

With MCP, call `cass_view` using the same arguments without `op` or `id`.
Copy **all four coordinates** from one search hit. They are not interchangeable:
`source_path` and `source_id` must match the stored conversation exactly,
`conversation_id` must be positive, and `message_index` is the one-based
canonical ordinal. No source alias, path normalization, raw-file fallback or
neighbour substitution is attempted. The named source file need not exist;
its path is compared as identity data and is never opened.

`context` defaults to zero and accepts 0–20 actual messages on each side.
Sparse indices are preserved: for indices 8, 13 and 100, a view of 13 with
context 1 returns those three messages, not the arithmetic range 12–14.
The target must exist exactly. Identity checks, metadata selection and body
hydration share one explicit read transaction through the production strict
FrankenSQLite reader; requested malformed content or ambiguous coordinates
fail the entire operation. Database files that are symlinks are rejected at
admission. This preliminary path check is not an atomic filesystem path pin.

A view returns root source/conversation coordinates, `messages` with exact
`message_id`, `message_index`, `role`, complete `content`, and `is_target`, plus
`content_bytes` and `more_before` / `more_after`. The latter fields are null
when context is zero because no neighbour probe occurs. There is no
whole-conversation count or archive-integrity claim.

The complete window is limited to **64 KiB of UTF-8 message-body bytes**.
Byte-length guards run inside SQL before oversized content is transferred to
the service, and count embedded NULs and multibyte characters. Content is
never shortened to manufacture success. Oversized windows return
`canonical_payload_too_large`; reduce context or use the explicit CLI follow-up
for a larger individual message. The existing 1 MiB encoded response limit
still applies, including both MCP result representations and JSON escaping.
Other typed errors distinguish missing targets, identity mismatches, invalid
coordinates and elapsed cooperative budgets; storage failures retain context.

Each view opens a **new canonical read snapshot**, releases its transaction and
closes its reader before the next request. It does not replace or relabel the
retained lexical reader. Results state
`snapshot_policy: "one_archive_read_transaction_per_view"`,
`matches_lexical_snapshot: null`, and `lexical_freshness: "not_checked"`.
A successful view is not proof that the earlier search preview is current.
Status exposes capability and attempted/completed read counters without
probing either storage path.

The 3-second lookup budget is cooperative: checked between admission and SQL
operations, with no partial result on expiry. It does **not** interrupt an
individual engine call, bound engine-internal allocation, or replace the
host's process-level deadline. No maintenance, recovery write, model loading,
raw transcript read, arbitrary SQL or new filesystem authority is provided.
The enclosing service request deadline also covers this lookup, including an
individual native SQL call, by terminating the worker if necessary.

## Shared reader admission (explicit opt-in)

Use `--admission-dir /trusted/local/cass-reader-pool --admission-slots 1`
on `cass serve --stdio` or `cass serve --stdio --mcp`. Every cooperating
worker must use the same local directory and slot count, including workers
serving different indexes. Counts are 1–64, default one. Without the directory
option, shared admission is disabled. This is not a query relay: reuse an
admitted worker for repeated queries.

A worker acquires one kernel-backed lease before opening its lexical reader
and retains it through reader destruction. A canonical view uses the existing
lease or a temporary one through archive close. Busy admission returns
`admission_busy` before index-open or canonical-read counters advance. Failed
opens release their temporary lease. Status and invalid requests do not
initialize or inspect the pool.

`unload` / MCP `cass_unload` releases the reader and then its lease without
closing the connection. The next query reacquires and reopens. Reload also
releases first; another process can win the slot, leaving a failed reloader
unloaded. Kernel locks release on process termination; PIDs and timestamps
are not ownership certificates. Existing deadlines and source checks remain.

This explicit option writes only a versioned policy and fixed slot lock files.
Choose a private trusted local directory outside indexes and source trees.
Never delete, replace or move pool files or the directory while workers may
be alive: this splits the lock namespace. Different slot counts and partial
policies fail closed with `admission_policy_mismatch`; there is no automatic
repair or stale-file deletion. Symlink preflight is not an atomic sandbox
against a hostile directory owner; network-filesystem locking is unqualified.

The limit covers participating reader owners, not total machine memory. Other
programs, workers without the option, and allocator-retained pages after
unload are outside the count. Status reports the scope, slots and held lease.

## Resident-memory supervision

Every `cass serve` worker now samples its own resident memory, including idle
retained readers and reader teardown. The default termination threshold is
**4,096 MiB**; set `--max-resident-mib 2048` for 2 GiB. Accepted values are
1–1,048,576 MiB; zero and overflow cannot disable monitoring. These are
operator-selected budgets, not measured corpus requirements or throughput claims.

The first fresh sample is obtained before any storage request. Subsequent
samples are requested every 100 ms using only the worker PID, without
enumerating Linux tasks or reading other processes' command lines/environments.
Missing or zero samples are failures, never permission to reuse a stale low
value. An unsupported measurement prevents startup. A later reported probe
failure terminates with exit **125**. Status reads the last observations
without starting an additional probe.

When a sample exceeds the threshold, the entire worker exits **126**, without
waiting for the query, acquiring output locks, flushing partial frames, or
running reader destructors. Kernel reader-pool leases release on process death.
Discard an incomplete response line and restart/reinitialize before retrying.
A normal EOF closes readers and joins the monitor within the teardown deadline.

`memory_supervision` reports the byte threshold, latest sampled resident bytes,
peak among observed samples, sample age/count, interval and exit codes. This is
**not a kernel-enforced allocation limit or a peak-RSS guarantee**: allocations
can overshoot between samples, OS probes and scheduling take time, and swapped
out memory is not resident memory. Process-tree memory and other applications
are outside the measurement. A stuck OS probe is not preempted by this sampler;
active request deadlines and external host supervision remain important.

Shared reader admission and memory monitoring address different risks: the
pool limits cooperating reader owners, while this guard limits continued
execution after an observed per-worker overage. An unloaded allocator can
still retain pages, so the pool count times this threshold is not a machine-wide
memory certificate. For strict allocation containment use an OS-managed
process/container budget as well. Neither feature adds semantic serving.

## Candidate-only neural refinement (explicit opt-in)

Use `refine` when a cheap lexical query finds plausible messages but their
order does not answer the actual question. It does **not** open a global
embedding/vector/HNSW generation. Instead it retrieves one finite lexical
shortlist, then runs the existing native cross-encoder only over each hit's
title and index snippet. A separate question can guide relevance without
making the lexical candidate query unnecessarily restrictive.

Enable it with an already-installed, compatible native MS MARCO MiniLM
reranker directory containing safetensors weights and `tokenizer.json`:

```sh
cass serve --stdio --mcp --data-dir /path/to/cass-data \
  --reranker-model /path/to/models/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
```

This path is fixed at startup. There is no default inferred model directory,
network download, daemon fallback, or per-request model path. Initialization,
discovery, status, ordinary `search`, and empty refinement results do not load
the model. The first nonempty refinement loads it locally; later refinements
reuse it. A previously loaded model remains resident during ordinary searches,
but those searches never invoke it. `reload` releases the model and old lexical
reader before opening a new lexical reader; it does not eagerly reload the
model. The next nonempty refinement may load that same configured path again.
Shutdown and the existing request/teardown deadlines cover both retained owners.

Without `--mcp`, send:

```json
{"op":"refine","id":10,"lexical_query":"performance","query":"Which changes reduced search latency?","filters":{"workspaces":["/my/project"],"source_id":"work-laptop"},"candidate_limit":20,"limit":5}
```

With MCP, call `cass_refine` with the same arguments except `op` and `id`.
The tool is advertised only with `--reranker-model`; guessing its name cannot
enable model access. Canonical `--db` permission is neither required nor used.
The existing MCP quota and whole-request watchdog include refinement, including
model loading and native inference. No queued background work continues after
the worker exits on its deadline.

Both query strings must be nonempty and at most 4,096 UTF-8 bytes. The existing
lexical filters retain their exact semantics. `candidate_limit` defaults to 20
and accepts 1–32; `limit` defaults to 5 and must be 1–`candidate_limit`. A lexical
probe can retrieve one additional hit to detect further candidates, but at most
`candidate_limit` previews enter inference. Each input preview is at most
8,192 bytes, and the complete input is capped at 256 KiB, counting the relevance
query again for each candidate pair. Admission happens before model loading.
These are input bounds, not a guarantee about model/engine resident memory.

Each returned hit retains its original lexical `score`, all source/conversation/
message coordinates, and preview fields. `rerank_score` is separate, and
`lexical_rank` records its one-based position before refinement. Scores must be
finite and map one-to-one to inputs; malformed outputs fail rather than invent
scores or discard identities. Equal scores keep lexical order.

`candidates_considered` and `ranking_scope: "bounded_lexical_candidate_pool"`
make the boundary explicit. `more_lexical_candidates` is true only when an
additional lexical hit was observed, otherwise null (unknown). There is no
refinement pagination: `next_offset` is null, and an `offset` request is rejected.
Changing the candidate pool can change every winner's rank. Increase or narrow
the explicit pool rather than treating a lexical offset as ranked continuation.

The result remains **preview-only**: the model receives title + newline + index
snippet, not full canonical message bodies. The native tokenizer may further
truncate query/passage pairs; `model_input_may_be_token_truncated` reports that
possibility rather than claiming complete-message scoring. Use `cass_view`
separately to verify the winners against the canonical archive. Refinement adds
no freshness proof and cannot find semantically related messages outside the
lexical candidate pool. Global semantic/HNSW retrieval remains a separate lane.

An empty pool returns `refinement.status: "no_candidates"` without loading a
model. Nonempty success returns `"applied"`, model reuse/setup/inference details,
and the observed model counters. `model_epoch` is session-local, not a model
file digest or version certificate. Missing or incompatible files and inference
failures produce `refinement_failed`, never relabeled lexical scores. Ordinary
search remains usable after such an error. Without startup permission,
JSON-lines returns `refinement_disabled` and MCP treats `cass_refine` as unknown.

The normal service regression target covers admission, ranking projection,
empty and missing-model behavior, MCP permission/quota rules, and binary dispatch.
A separate opt-in test exercises the real model and retained reader together:

```sh
CASS_TEST_RERANKER_MODEL=/path/to/models/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 \
  cargo test --locked --test search_service \
  search_service::refinement::tests::native_refinement_reuses_real_model_and_reader_without_global_semantic_assets \
  -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

Run native tests through the repository's normal verification environment.
The opt-in test is not a passing test until the model-backed command executes.

Refinement uses the same admission lease as its lexical shortlist. A busy pool
returns `admission_busy` before index or model loading; `unload`, `reload`,
shutdown and EOF release the model before the lease. Resident-memory sampling
and the whole-request deadline remain active during model loading and inference.
