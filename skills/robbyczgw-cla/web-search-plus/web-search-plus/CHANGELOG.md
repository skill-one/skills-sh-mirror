# Changelog - Web Search Plus

## [4.3.1] - 2026-09-24

Ported applicable Hermes runtime changes into the source-only CLI:

- Preserve leading dashes and literal `--` in query arguments (`4400fc9`).
- Prefer Exa highlights, send Tavily native date filters, and reuse Exa request dates in normal, cached, and research receipts (`55d4d08`). Explicit date bounds have separate cache keys.
- Cap search-cache TTL by recency and effective date filter; retain `--cache-ttl`, `--no-cache`, and cache-age output (`33f415e`, `90e9c3a`).
- Record each search-provider attempt, including retries and research members. Exclude cache hits and configuration errors. Lock statistics updates across POSIX processes, with thread-only fallback when `fcntl` is unavailable (`9bd7d36`).
- Keep configured default counts and explicit-count precedence; clamp counts to 1–20 (`0345748` release line).
- Share keep-alive connections across search and extraction calls. Bypass pooling for proxies or `WSP_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=0`; retry stale pooled sockets once (`c6da1e3`).

Skipped: semantic spans and `spans_query`, plugin request adapters, budget guards, provider SDK cleanup, research span ranking, Jev, Parallel, DonSeTch, Hermes native backend and desktop settings. These have no matching runtime here. No providers or dependencies were added.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-31

Source-only skill release. Not a port of OpenClaw plugin 4.0.3.

### Breaking
- **Removed Perplexity / Kilo Gateway.** The skill no longer calls `api.kilo.ai`, no longer reads `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` / `KILOCODE_API_KEY`, and no longer routes or auto-completes `-p perplexity`. Leftover config keys are ignored.
- Public output stays ranked source URLs and extracted page text. Model-written answers are out of scope.

### Not in this release
- DonSeTch, Parallel, Octen, and TinyFish stay on the native plugin (`web-search-plus-plugin-v2`), not this CLI skill.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-05

Feature sync with `web-search-plus-plugin` v3.2.0 (hermes-web-search-plus v2.5.0–v2.9.0), adapted for this skill's CLI/filesystem runtime.

### Added
- **Keenable provider** (search + extraction) using Keenable's independent web index: keyed via `KEENABLE_API_KEY` (`X-API-Key`), or keyless against the **opt-in** public tier (`WSP_KEENABLE_ALLOW_PUBLIC=1` or `"keenable": {"allow_public": true}` in config.json; ~1000 req/hour shared, no SLA, warning in result metadata). Lowest priority in auto routing (score 0, excluded from ties) and extraction fallback so it never displaces a configured keyed provider. (Plugin/hermes v2.6.0)
- **Unified `--freshness`** (`day`/`week`/`month`/`year`): providers with native date filters (Serper, Brave, Querit, Firecrawl, Keenable, SerpBase, You.com, Perplexity, SearXNG) receive the mapped value; providers without support run the normal search and report `freshness.applied=false` in `metadata.freshness`. Research mode reports per-provider application. (Hermes v2.8.0)
- **News vertical**: `--type news` on Serper now parses the `news` response field correctly (date, source, thumbnail, position) instead of silently returning zero results; other providers report `search_type.applied=false` in `metadata.search_type`. (Hermes v2.9.0)
- **Serper extraction**: `scripts/extract.py --provider serper` scrapes pages via Serper's webpage scraper (`https://scrape.serper.dev`, markdown preferred, per-URL error items). It joins the auto-extraction fallback chain in last position. (Hermes v2.9.0)
- **Tavily-first extraction fallback** (plugin v2.6/v3 parity): auto order is now tavily → exa → linkup → firecrawl → you → keenable → serper (was firecrawl-first).
- **Configurable search locale defaults** with lightweight query language detection (new `scripts/search_locale.py`): `locale.country` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) and `locale.language` (ISO 639-1 or `"auto"`) in config.json — or `WSP_LOCALE_COUNTRY`/`WSP_LOCALE_LANGUAGE` — replace the hardcoded us/en defaults for Serper, Brave, Querit, Firecrawl, You.com, and SearXNG. Explicit `--country`/`--language` CLI flags always win; explicit location hints from a curated city/country table win over config ("mejores restaurantes Madrid" → `es`); `locale.language: "auto"` enables a conservative stopword/character heuristic for de/es/fr/it/pt/nl/en (at least two distinct signals with a single unambiguous winner). Query language never implies the country. `metadata.locale` reports the resolved values and per-value source. Without configuration behavior stays exactly us/en. (Hermes v2.9.0)
- **Spam/mirror result filtering** (new helpers in `scripts/quality.py`): results from known Stack Overflow/GitHub/documentation mirror domains are removed (strict exact-domain/true-subdomain matching, no look-alike false positives). Operators can extend via `quality.blocked_domains` or rescue via `quality.allowed_domains` in config.json. Domain-diversity reranking caps a single domain at 2 head slots (overflow demoted, not dropped). Explicit domain intent (`site:` queries, `--include-domains`) bypasses both. Removals and demotions are reported in `metadata.result_filter`. (Hermes v2.5.0)
- **Adaptive provider performance memory** (new `scripts/provider_stats.py`): every provider call records latency/result-count/error into a rolling window (50 samples, 7-day freshness) that feeds bounded (±1.0) routing-score adjustments after 5 fresh samples — enough to break ties and nudge close calls, never enough to override a clear query-class winner. Reported as `routing.adaptive_adjustments`. Skill adaptation: the window is persisted to `provider_stats.json` in the cache directory (0700/0600, atomic writes) because each CLI call is a fresh process; `WSP_DISABLE_CACHE=1` keeps samples process-local. (Hermes v2.5.0)

### Security
- Extraction SSRF guard extended: CGNAT/shared address space (`100.64.0.0/10`) and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:10.0.0.1`) are now blocked like the other private ranges. (Hermes v2.7.0 parity)
- Domain boost matching no longer grants authority boosts (or spam-block matches) to look-alike domains that merely contain a trusted domain string (for example `openai.com.evil.example`); label-prefix rules such as `docs.` now match only a leading host label. (Hermes v2.8.0)
- Inline base64 image data in extracted content is replaced with `[IMAGE: alt]` placeholders before measuring content, preventing data-URI token bombs while preserving normal `http(s)` image links. (Hermes v2.8.0)

### Improved
- Rate-limit handling: 429 responses parse `Retry-After` (delta-seconds or HTTP-date), retry at most once (short waits ≤30s honored inline), and feed the provider's requested wait into the cooldown ladder (capped at the 1h ladder max) instead of hanging the request. (Hermes v2.5.0)
- Provider cooldown escalation now decays stale failure history (older than 30 minutes) instead of punishing isolated old failures forever. (Hermes v2.5.0)
- Provider configuration errors such as missing API keys no longer mark providers unhealthy, trigger cooldowns, or skew the adaptive performance memory; cooldown stays reserved for real provider/network failures. (Hermes v2.7.0)
- Oversized extracted pages return a head/tail window plus an explanatory footer; the inline budget is configurable via `WSP_EXTRACT_CHAR_LIMIT` or `--extract-char-limit` (default 15000). (Hermes v2.8.0)
- Provider JSON decode failures now surface as clear transient provider errors, improving retry/fallback behavior. (Hermes v2.8.0)
- Transient HTTP codes extended from {429, 503} to {408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504}, matching the plugin's retry classification.

### Not ported
- The Parallel provider (plugin v3.0.0) remains out of scope for the skill, matching the 3.1.0 parity decision.
- Plugin-only surfaces (`web_routing_config_plus`, in-memory-only cache/health, onboarding CLI) are host-runtime specific; the skill keeps its CLI flags, config.json, and disk cache equivalents.

### Tests
- New `tests/test_v33_plugin_sync.py`: freshness/search-type metadata, Serper news parsing, Keenable endpoint/public-tier/tie-exclusion, spam filter + allowlist + look-alike immunity, domain diversity, domain constraints, adaptive stats bounds/staleness, Retry-After parsing, cooldown decay + Retry-After cap, base64 sanitization, head/tail truncation, extraction order, keenable extraction fallback, CGNAT + IPv4-mapped IPv6 SSRF blocks.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-10

Feature sync with `hermes-web-search-plus` v2.3.0/v2.4.0 plus security fixes for the SkillSpector scan findings.

### Added
- **Research mode** (`--mode research`, port of hermes v2.4.0): queries up to three providers **concurrently** (wall-clock cost ≈ slowest provider instead of the sum), deduplicates across providers with deterministic ordering (preserved by submission order regardless of completion order), then extracts the top sources for grounding via `scripts/extract.py`. New flags: `--research-providers`, `--research-extract-count` (default 3), `--research-time-budget` (default 55s — gates which providers launch and whether extraction runs; exhausted steps surface as diagnostics instead of failures).
- **Canonical-source intent reranking** (port of hermes v2.3.0): `rerank_results_for_intent()` + `CANONICAL_DOMAIN_RULES` boost primary sources and demote mirror/aggregator domains for the routing classes `official_vendor_release`, `official_docs`, `policy_pdf`, `finance_earnings_official`, and `security_advisory` (detected via a new compact `QueryAnalyzer._detect_routing_class()`). Reordered results are flagged in `metadata.intent_rerank`.
- **Quality reports** (`--quality-report`): transparent routing/result diagnostics including `authority_signals` (`canonical_domain_hits`, `demoted_domain_hits`, `canonical_top_result`). Research mode always attaches a quality report.
- **ProviderSpec registry** (`scripts/provider_registry.py`, port of hermes v2.3.0): single source of truth for provider metadata (env vars, API hosts, capabilities, signup URLs). `search.py` key resolution/validation, `extract.py` credentials, and CLI provider choices now read from it.
- New modules `scripts/quality.py` and `scripts/research.py`; `scripts/search.py` re-exports the shared helpers (`normalize_result_url`, `deduplicate_results_across_providers`, `_choose_tie_winner`, …) so existing imports keep working.

### Security (SkillSpector findings)
- **Vague triggers (HIGH)**: replaced the generic manifest triggers (`search`, `find`, `look up`, `research`) with narrowly scoped phrases (`web search plus`, `wsp search`, `search the web for`, `multi-provider web search`, `extract url content`, `extract content from url`). Remaining triggers documented in SKILL.md.
- **Undisclosed third-party transmission (MEDIUM)**: added prominent "Data handling & privacy" sections to SKILL.md, README, and FAQ stating that search queries and extraction URLs are sent to the configured third-party providers, with guidance to use explicit provider selection for sensitive work and avoid submitting internal/private URLs.
- **Silent local caching (MEDIUM)**: caching of queries/results/provider failure history under `WSP_CACHE_DIR` (`.cache` default, including `provider_health.json`) is now disclosed in all docs; cache directory is created mode `0700` and cache/health files are written mode `0600` via atomic temp-file replace; added `WSP_DISABLE_CACHE=1` global toggle (the existing `--no-cache` / `--clear-cache` / `--cache-stats` flags are now documented prominently).
- **SSRF / tainted URL flow (MEDIUM)**: new `scripts/url_security.py` guard (mirrors the SearXNG SSRF guard) validates all user-supplied URLs before extraction or forwarding (`scripts/extract.py` URLs and `--similar-url`): http/https only, hostname resolution with private/loopback/link-local/reserved ranges blocked (10/8, 127/8, 169.254/16, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, ::1, fc00::/7, fe80::/10, 0.0.0.0), and cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, metadata.google.internal) always blocked. Explicit opt-out for trusted private networks via `--allow-private-urls` or `WSP_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS=1` (off by default).
- **Missing permission declarations (MEDIUM)**: `package.json → clawhub.permissions` and the SKILL.md metadata now declare outbound network access (listed provider API hosts only), environment reads (`*_API_KEY`, `SEARXNG_*`, `WSP_*`), and filesystem writes (cache directory only).
- **Description-behavior mismatch (LOW)**: skill descriptions in `package.json` and SKILL.md now mention local caching and provider-health persistence.
- **Credential redaction (defense in depth)**: provider error messages are scrubbed of any configured credential values (env- and config.json-sourced) before they reach stderr, fallback error lists, extraction error fields, or the persisted `provider_health.json` — even if a provider echoes a key back in an error body, it never leaves memory.

### Improved
- Retry backoff now adds bounded random jitter (`RETRY_JITTER_FRACTION = 0.5`) so concurrent or repeated retries against a recovering provider do not synchronize into bursts (port of hermes v2.4.0).
- Provider-health read-modify-write is guarded by a lock and written atomically, so concurrent in-process provider calls (research mode) cannot lose cooldown updates or tear the file (port of hermes v2.4.0).

### Fixed
- Auto-routing's suggested Exa depth (`deep`/`deep-reasoning`) is now actually propagated into the provider call: `routing_info` previously never carried `exa_depth` (or `analysis_summary`), so the auto-upgrade path was dead code.
- In Docker environments without a configured SearXNG instance, the auto-detected local URL no longer raises an unhandled `ValueError` out of `get_api_key()` when it fails SSRF validation — SearXNG is treated as unconfigured instead.

### Tests
- New `tests/test_security.py`: trigger-scope checks, manifest permission declarations, SSRF validation (scheme rejection, private IP literals, metadata endpoints with opt-in still blocked, mocked private/public DNS resolution, extract-level blocking), cache dir/file permissions (0700/0600), cache roundtrip, and `--no-cache` / `WSP_DISABLE_CACHE` behavior through `main()`.
- New `tests/test_research_and_quality.py`: research-mode merge/dedup/extraction, out-of-order completion ordering, time-budget gating, extraction-failure resilience, provider selection, quality reports, authority signals, canonical reranking, routing-class detection, retry-jitter bounds, registry consistency, and an end-to-end rerank + quality-report pipeline regression test.

### Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible CLI: all existing flags, defaults, output fields, and the `scripts.search` import surface are unchanged; new behavior is opt-in (`--mode research`, `--quality-report`) except for (a) intent reranking, which can reorder results for the five canonical-source query classes, (b) the SSRF guard, which now rejects private/metadata extraction targets unless explicitly allowed, and (c) stricter cache file permissions.
- Skill manifest triggers are intentionally narrower; invoke the skill with the scoped phrases documented in SKILL.md.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **SerpBase provider integration** (closes [#4](https://github.com/robbyczgw-cla/web-search-plus/issues/4)) — low-cost Google SERP API with prepaid credits. Brings the skill to parity with `web-search-plus-plugin` v3.0.0.
  - New `search_serpbase()` function in `scripts/search.py` (Python port of plugin's canonical `searchSerpBase()` impl)
  - Explicit/fallback-only by design — NOT in default `provider_priority`. Opt-in via `--provider serpbase` OR append to `auto_routing.provider_priority` in `config.json`
  - New env var `SERPBASE_API_KEY` (https://serpbase.dev)
  - Treats HTTP 402/429 as transient (quota/rate-limit retry); business-error status fields surface as `ProviderRequestError`
  - SKILL.md + README + `.env.example` + `config.example.json` updated; package version bumped 3.0.3 → 3.1.0

## Unreleased

### Removed
- Removed the stale standalone homepage HTML from the OpenClaw Skill repository; `websearchplus.xyz` is maintained in the dedicated `websearchplus-xyz` homepage repository.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Version bump (previous version already published)

## [3.0.2] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Fixed gzip/deflate/brotli decompression for HTTP responses across all providers
  - Added `_response_header()` and `_read_response_body()` helpers with Content-Encoding handling
  - Fixed 4 vulnerable `response.read().decode()` calls in `search.py` (make_request, make_get_request, search_youcom, search_searxng)
  - Fixed 1 vulnerable call in `extract.py` (request_json)
  - Removed forced `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header from Brave search (was causing guaranteed crash)
  - Added magic-number fallback (`b"\x1f\x8b"`) for mislabeled gzip responses
  - Brotli-encoded responses raise clear error instead of silent corruption

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Version bump (previous version already published)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Added **Brave**, **Linkup**, and **Firecrawl** as first-class Python search providers, bringing provider parity to 10 search backends.
- Added `scripts/extract.py` for **URL extraction with automatic fallback** across Firecrawl, Linkup, Tavily, Exa, and You.com.
- Added targeted unit tests for routing parity, deterministic tie-breaking, extraction URL validation, and extraction fallback behavior.

### Changed
- Rebased `scripts/search.py` on newer Hermes parity logic while preserving this skill's Docker-aware SearXNG handling and local protections.
- Updated setup wizard, env template, config example, README, package metadata, and SKILL metadata for the 3.0.0 release.
- Default provider priority is now `tavily -> linkup -> querit -> exa -> firecrawl -> perplexity -> brave -> serper -> you -> searxng`.

### Notes
- Search parity is substantially improved with the OpenClaw plugin and Hermes port, but this skill still exposes the extraction flow as a companion script rather than a separate OpenClaw tool wrapper.

## [2.9.3] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Docker-aware SearXNG auto-detection for zero-config local setups
- New `scripts/docker_detect.py` helper that detects containerized execution via `/.dockerenv`, `/proc/1/cgroup`, and `DOCKER`

### Changed
- `get_searxng_instance_url()` now falls back to auto-detected defaults when no explicit SearXNG URL is configured
- Uses `http://172.17.0.1:8080` inside Docker sandboxes and `http://127.0.0.1:8080` on the host for smoother local SearXNG access

### Release Notes
- Bumped skill/package metadata for the 2.9.3 ClawHub publish
- Based on merged GitHub PR #2: `feat: add Docker-aware SearXNG auto-detection`

## [2.9.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Replaced hardcoded temporary cache path examples with portable `$TMP_DIR` placeholders in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-12

### ✨ New Provider: Querit (Multilingual AI Search)

[Querit.ai](https://querit.ai) is a Singapore-based multilingual AI search API purpose-built for LLMs and RAG pipelines. 300 billion page index, 20+ countries, 10+ languages.

- Added **Querit** as the 7th search provider via `https://api.querit.ai/v1/search`
- Configure via `QUERIT_API_KEY` — optional, gracefully skipped if not set
- Routing score: `research * 0.65 + rag * 0.35 + recency * 0.45` — favored for multilingual and real-time queries
- Handles Querit's quirky `error_code=200` responses as success (not an error)
- Handles `IncompleteRead` as transient/retryable failure
- Live-tested with 10 benchmark queries ✅

### 🔧 Fixed: Fallback chain dies on unconfigured provider

- `sys.exit(1)` in `validate_api_key()` raised `SystemExit` (inherits from `BaseException`), which bypassed the `except Exception` fallback loop and killed the entire process instead of trying the next provider
- Replaced with catchable `ProviderConfigError` — fallback chain now continues correctly through all configured providers

### 🔧 Fixed: Perplexity citations are generic placeholders

- Previously extracted citation URLs via regex from the answer text, resulting in generic "Source 1" / "Source 2" labels
- Now uses the structured `data["citations"]` array from the Perplexity API response directly — results have readable titles
- Regex extraction kept as fallback when API doesn't return a `citations` field

### ✨ Improved: German locale routing patterns

- Added German-language signal patterns for local and news queries
- Improves auto-routing for queries like `"aktuelle Nachrichten"`, `"beste Restaurants Graz"`, `"KI Regulierung Europa"`

### 📝 Documentation

- Added Querit to README provider tables, routing examples, and API key setup section
- Added `querit_api_key` to `config.example.json`
- Updated `SKILL.md` provider mentions and env metadata
- Bumped package version to `2.9.0`


## [2.8.6] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- Documented Perplexity Sonar Pro usage and refreshed release docs.


## [2.8.5] - 2026-02-20

### ✨ Feature: Perplexity freshness filter

- Added `freshness` parameter to Perplexity provider (`day`, `week`, `month`, `year`)
- Maps to Perplexity's native `search_recency_filter` parameter
- Example: `python3 scripts/search.py -p perplexity -q "latest AI news" --freshness day`
- Consistent with freshness support in Serper and Brave providers

## [2.8.4] - 2026-02-20

### 🔒 Security Fix: SSRF protection in setup wizard

- **Fixed:** `setup.py` SearXNG connection test had no SSRF protection (unlike `search.py`)
- **Before:** Operator could be tricked into probing internal networks during setup
- **After:** Same IP validation as `search.py` — blocks private IPs, cloud metadata, loopback
- **Credit:** ClawHub security scanner

## [2.8.3] - 2026-02-20

### 🐛 Critical Fix: Perplexity results empty

- **Fixed:** Perplexity provider returned 0 results because the AI-synthesized answer wasn't mapped into the results array
- **Before:** Only extracted URLs from the answer text were returned as results (often 0)
- **After:** The full answer is now the primary result (title, snippet with cleaned text), extracted source URLs follow as additional results
- **Impact:** Perplexity queries now always return at least 1 result with the synthesized answer

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-20

### 🆕 New Provider: Perplexity (AI-Synthesized Answers)

Added Perplexity as the 6th search provider via Kilo Gateway — the first provider that returns **direct answers with citations** instead of just links:

#### Features
- **AI-Synthesized Answers**: Get a complete answer, not a list of links
- **Inline Citations**: Every claim backed by `[1][2][3]` source references
- **Real-Time Web Search**: Perplexity searches the web live, reads pages, and summarizes
- **Zero Extra Config**: Works through Kilo Gateway with your existing `KILOCODE_API_KEY`
- **Model**: `perplexity/sonar-pro` (best quality, supports complex queries)

#### Auto-Routing Signals
New direct-answer intent detection routes to Perplexity for:
- Status queries: "status of", "current state of", "what is the status"
- Local info: "events in [city]", "things to do in", "what's happening in"
- Direct questions: "what is", "who is", "when did", "how many"
- Current affairs: "this week", "this weekend", "right now", "today"

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# Auto-routed
python3 scripts/search.py -q "events in Graz Austria this weekend"  # → Perplexity
python3 scripts/search.py -q "what is the current status of Ethereum"  # → Perplexity

# Explicit
python3 scripts/search.py -p perplexity -q "latest AI regulation news"
```

#### Configuration
Requires `KILOCODE_API_KEY` environment variable (Kilo Gateway account).
No additional API key needed — Perplexity is accessed through Kilo's unified API.

```bash
export KILOCODE_API_KEY="your-kilo-key"
```

### 🔧 Routing Rebalance

Major overhaul of the auto-routing confidence scoring to fix Serper dominance:

#### Problem
Serper (Google) was winning ~90% of queries due to:
- High recency multiplier boosting Serper on any query with dates/years
- Default provider priority placing Serper first in ties
- Research and discovery signals not strong enough to override

#### Changes
- **Lowered Serper recency multiplier** — date mentions no longer auto-route to Google
- **Strengthened research signals** for Tavily:
  - Added: "status of", "what happened with", "how does X compare"
  - Boosted weights for comparison patterns (4.0 → 5.0)
- **Strengthened discovery signals** for Exa:
  - Added: "events in", "things to do in", "startups similar to"
  - Boosted weights for local discovery patterns
- **Updated provider priority order**: `tavily → exa → perplexity → serper → you → searxng`
  - Serper moved from 1st to 4th in tie-breaking
  - Research/discovery providers now win on ambiguous queries

#### Routing Test Results

| Query | Before | After | ✓ |
|-------|--------|-------|---|
| "latest OpenClaw version Feb 2026" | Serper | Serper | ✅ |
| "Ethereum Pectra upgrade status" | Serper | **Tavily** | ✅ |
| "events in Graz this weekend" | Serper | **Perplexity** | ✅ |
| "compare SearXNG vs Brave for AI agents" | Serper | **Tavily** | ✅ |
| "Sam Altman OpenAI news this week" | Serper | Serper | ✅ |
| "find startups similar to Kilo Code" | Serper | **Exa** | ✅ |

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-14

### ✨ Added
- Provider cooldown tracking in `.cache/provider_health.json`
- Exponential cooldown on provider failures: **1m → 5m → 25m → 1h (cap)**
- Retry strategy for transient failures (timeout, 429, 503): up to 2 retries with backoff **1s → 3s → 9s**
- Smarter cache keys hashed from full request context (query/provider/max_results + locale, freshness, time_range, topic, search_engines, include_news, and related params)
- Cross-provider result deduplication by normalized URL during fallback merge

### 🔧 Changed
- Cooldown providers are skipped in routing while their cooldown is active
- Provider health is reset automatically after successful requests
- Fallback output now includes dedup metadata:
  - `deduplicated: true|false`
  - `metadata.dedup_count`


## [2.6.5] - 2026-02-11

### 🆕 File-Based Result Caching

Added local caching to save API costs on repeated searches:

#### Features
- **Automatic Caching**: Search results cached locally by default
- **1-Hour TTL**: Results expire after 3600 seconds (configurable)
- **Cache Indicators**: Response includes `cached: true/false` and `cache_age_seconds`
- **Zero-Cost Repeats**: Cached requests don't hit APIs

#### New CLI Options
- `--cache-ttl SECONDS` — Custom cache TTL (default: 3600)
- `--no-cache` — Bypass cache, always fetch fresh
- `--clear-cache` — Delete all cached results
- `--cache-stats` — Show cache statistics (entries, size, age)

#### Configuration
- **Cache directory**: `.cache/` in skill directory
- **Environment variable**: `WSP_CACHE_DIR` to override location
- **Cache key**: Based on query + provider + max_results (SHA256)

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# First request costs API credits
python3 scripts/search.py -q "AI startups"

# Second request is FREE (uses cache)
python3 scripts/search.py -q "AI startups"

# Force fresh results
python3 scripts/search.py -q "AI startups" --no-cache

# View stats
python3 scripts/search.py --cache-stats

# Clear everything
python3 scripts/search.py --clear-cache
```

#### Technical Details
- Cache files: JSON with metadata (_cache_timestamp, _cache_key, etc.)
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries on access
- Graceful handling of corrupted cache files

## [2.6.1] - 2026-02-04

- Privacy cleanup: removed hardcoded paths and personal info from docs

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-03

### 🆕 New Provider: SearXNG (Privacy-First Meta-Search)

Added SearXNG as the 5th search provider, focused on privacy and self-hosted search:

#### Features
- **Privacy-Preserving**: No tracking, no profiling — your searches stay private
- **Multi-Source Aggregation**: Queries 70+ upstream engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.)
- **$0 API Cost**: Self-hosted = unlimited queries with no API fees
- **Diverse Results**: Get perspectives from multiple search engines in one query
- **Customizable**: Choose which engines to use, set SafeSearch levels, language preferences

#### Auto-Routing Signals
New privacy/multi-source intent detection routes to SearXNG for:

## [2.1.5] - 2026-01-27

### 📝 Documentation

- Added warning about NOT using Tavily/Serper/Exa in core OpenClaw config
- Core OpenClaw only supports `brave` as the built-in provider
- This skill's providers must be used via environment variables and scripts, not `openclaw.json`

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-23

### 🧠 Intelligent Multi-Signal Routing

Completely overhauled auto-routing with sophisticated query analysis:

#### Intent Classification
- **Shopping Intent**: Detects price patterns ("how much", "cost of"), purchase signals ("buy", "order"), deal keywords, and product+brand combinations
- **Research Intent**: Identifies explanation patterns ("how does", "why does"), analysis signals ("pros and cons", "compare"), learning keywords, and complex multi-clause queries
- **Discovery Intent**: Recognizes similarity patterns ("similar to", "alternatives"), company discovery signals, URL/domain detection, and academic patterns

#### Linguistic Pattern Detection
- "How much" / "price of" → Shopping (Serper)
- "How does" / "Why does" / "Explain" → Research (Tavily)
- "Companies like" / "Similar to" / "Alternatives" → Discovery (Exa)
- Product + Brand name combos → Shopping (Serper)
- URLs and domains in query → Similar search (Exa)

#### Query Analysis Features
- **Complexity scoring**: Long, multi-clause queries get routed to research providers
- **URL detection**: Automatic detection of URLs/domains triggers Exa similar search
- **Brand recognition**: Tech brands (Apple, Samsung, Sony, etc.) with product terms → shopping
- **Recency signals**: "latest", "2026", "breaking" boost news mode

#### Confidence Scoring
- **HIGH (70-100%)**: Strong signal match, very reliable routing
- **MEDIUM (40-69%)**: Good match, should work well
- **LOW (0-39%)**: Ambiguous query, using fallback provider
- Confidence based on absolute signal strength + relative margin over alternatives

#### Enhanced Debug Mode
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py --explain-routing -q "your query"
```

Now shows:
- Routing decision with confidence level
- All provider scores
- Top matched signals with weights
- Query analysis (complexity, URL detection, recency focus)
- All matched patterns per provider

### 🔧 Technical Changes

#### QueryAnalyzer Class
New `QueryAnalyzer` class with:
- `SHOPPING_SIGNALS`: 25+ weighted patterns for shopping intent
- `RESEARCH_SIGNALS`: 30+ weighted patterns for research intent
- `DISCOVERY_SIGNALS`: 20+ weighted patterns for discovery intent
- `LOCAL_NEWS_SIGNALS`: 25+ patterns for local/news queries
- `BRAND_PATTERNS`: Tech brand detection regex

#### Signal Weighting
- Multi-word phrases get higher weights (e.g., "how much" = 4.0 vs "price" = 3.0)
- Strong signals: price patterns (4.0), similarity patterns (5.0), URLs (5.0)
- Medium signals: product terms (2.5), learning keywords (2.5)
- Bonus scoring: Product+brand combo (+3.0), complex query (+2.5)

#### Improved Output Format
```json
{
  "routing": {
    "auto_routed": true,
    "provider": "serper",
    "confidence": 0.78,
    "confidence_level": "high",
    "reason": "high_confidence_match",
    "top_signals": [{"matched": "price", "weight": 3.0}],
    "scores": {"serper": 7.0, "tavily": 0.0, "exa": 0.0}
  }
}
```

### 📚 Documentation Updates

- **SKILL.md**: Complete rewrite with signal tables and confidence scoring guide
- **README.md**: Updated with intelligent routing examples and confidence levels
- **FAQ**: Updated to explain multi-signal analysis

### 🧪 Test Results

| Query | Provider | Confidence | Signals |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| "how much does iPhone 16 cost" | Serper | 68% | "how much", brand+product |
| "how does quantum entanglement work" | Tavily | 86% HIGH | "how does", "what are", "implications" |
| "startups similar to Notion" | Exa | 76% HIGH | "similar to", "Series A" |
| "companies like stripe.com" | Exa | 100% HIGH | URL detected, "companies like" |
| "MacBook Pro M3 specs review" | Serper | 70% HIGH | brand+product, "specs", "review" |
| "Tesla" | Serper | 0% LOW | No signals (fallback) |
| "arxiv papers on transformers" | Exa | 58% | "arxiv" |
| "latest AI news 2026" | Serper | 77% HIGH | "latest", "news", "2026" |
