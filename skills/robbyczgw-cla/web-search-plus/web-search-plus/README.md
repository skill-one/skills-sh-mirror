Unified multi-provider web search and URL extraction for OpenClaw-style agent workflows.

Current version: **4.3.1**

> **Status: stable OpenClaw skill — compatibility path, not the main engine-development path.**
> This OpenClaw skill is kept usable and periodically synced for OpenClaw users, but active engine development happens on **[hermes-web-search-plus](https://github.com/robbyczgw-cla/hermes-web-search-plus)** and the **[web-search-plus-mcp](https://github.com/robbyczgw-cla/web-search-plus-mcp)** server. Version 4.3.1 syncs applicable runtime fixes while keeping this CLI **source-only**. The native OpenClaw plugin remains `web-search-plus-plugin-v2` (currently 4.3.1).

## ⚠️ Data handling & privacy

- **Search queries and extraction URLs are sent to the configured third-party providers** (Serper, Brave, Tavily, Linkup, Querit, Exa, Firecrawl, SerpBase, Keenable, You.com, or your SearXNG instance). Each provider's privacy policy and retention rules apply to what you send.
- **For sensitive queries, pick the provider explicitly** with `--provider <name>` so you control which third party receives them; self-hosted SearXNG keeps queries on your own infrastructure.
- **Avoid submitting internal/private URLs for extraction** — extraction URLs are forwarded to external services. Private/loopback/link-local targets and cloud metadata endpoints are blocked by default (opt out with `--allow-private-urls` / `WSP_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS=1` for trusted private networks).
- **Local caching is on by default**: queries, results, provider failure history (`provider_health.json`), and provider performance samples for adaptive routing (`provider_stats.json`) are persisted under `.cache` (or `WSP_CACHE_DIR`) with owner-only permissions (dir `0700`, files `0600`). Use `--no-cache` per call, `WSP_DISABLE_CACHE=1` globally, `--clear-cache` to wipe, `--cache-stats` to inspect.
- **API keys are never logged or cached.**

## What changed in 4.3.1

- Queries starting with a dash reach providers unchanged: use `--query=-foo` or `-q -- "-foo"`.
- Exa snippets prefer highlights. Tavily receives native date filters, and Exa receipts reuse the publication bounds sent with each request, including research mode. `--time-range` wins over `--freshness`.
- `--cache-ttl SECONDS` now respects recency caps: live/hour 60 seconds, latest/day 300 seconds, week filters 1800 seconds. Cache hits include their age.
- Adaptive routing records every search-provider attempt, including retries and research members. POSIX file locking prevents concurrent writers from losing samples.
- Omitted counts use `defaults.max_results`; explicit `-n` wins. Both are clamped to 1–20.
- Search and extraction reuse HTTP connections per host within a process. Proxies and `WSP_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=0` use the standard transport. A stale pooled socket gets one retry on a fresh connection.
- The provider list stays unchanged. Jev, Parallel, DonSeTch, Hermes native backends and desktop settings remain outside this skill.

## What changed in 4.0.0

- **Source-only.** Perplexity via Kilo (`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` / `KILOCODE_API_KEY`) is removed from routing, CLI, config, and docs. Leftover keys and `provider_priority` entries are ignored.
- This is **not** a copy of plugin 4.0.3: no DonSeTch, Parallel, Octen, or TinyFish in this skill runtime.
- Ranked source URLs and extracted page text only — no model-written answers.

## What changed in 3.3.0

Feature sync with `web-search-plus-plugin` v3.2.0 (hermes-web-search-plus v2.5.0–v2.9.0), adapted for the skill's CLI runtime:

- **Keenable** search + extraction provider — independent web index, keyed (`KEENABLE_API_KEY`) or keyless via the **opt-in** shared public tier (`WSP_KEENABLE_ALLOW_PUBLIC=1`, ~1000 req/hour, no SLA). Lowest priority everywhere: it never displaces a configured keyed provider.
- **Unified `--freshness`** (`day`/`week`/`month`/`year`): native date filters where supported, `freshness.applied=false` in metadata otherwise.
- **News vertical** (`--type news`): Serper serves Google News natively with correct parsing (date, source, thumbnail, position); other providers report `search_type.applied=false`.
- **Serper extraction** via the `scrape.serper.dev` webpage scraper — last position in the fallback chain, which is now **Tavily-first**: tavily → exa → linkup → firecrawl → you → keenable → serper.
- **Locale-aware defaults** with lightweight query language detection (`locale.country`/`locale.language` in config, `WSP_LOCALE_COUNTRY`/`WSP_LOCALE_LANGUAGE`, `"auto"` language inference, curated location hints — "mejores restaurantes Madrid" → `es`).
- **Spam/mirror result filtering** (strict domain matching, `quality.blocked_domains`/`quality.allowed_domains`), **domain-diversity reranking** (max 2 head slots per domain), `site:`/`--include-domains` bypass, reported via `metadata.result_filter`.
- **Adaptive provider performance memory**: rolling latency/result/error window (persisted as `provider_stats.json`) feeding bounded ±1.0 routing-score adjustments (`routing.adaptive_adjustments`).
- **Robustness**: `Retry-After` parsing with a single bounded inline retry for 429s, cooldown ladder decay after 30 minutes, configuration errors no longer trigger cooldowns, JSON decode failures surface as provider errors; transient HTTP codes now include 408/425/500/502/504.
- **Security**: extraction SSRF guard extended (CGNAT `100.64/10`, IPv4-mapped IPv6); look-alike domains no longer inherit authority boosts; inline base64 images replaced with `[IMAGE: alt]` placeholders; oversized extractions truncate to a head/tail window (`WSP_EXTRACT_CHAR_LIMIT`, default 15000).

## What changed in 3.2.0

- **Research mode** (`--mode research`): up to three providers queried **concurrently** with deterministic result ordering, cross-provider dedup, and top-source extraction for grounding; `--research-time-budget` gates provider launches and extraction (port of hermes-web-search-plus v2.4.0).
- **Canonical-source intent reranking** + `--quality-report` authority signals (`canonical_domain_hits`, `demoted_domain_hits`, `canonical_top_result`) for official-release/docs/policy/finance/security queries (port of hermes v2.3.0).
- **ProviderSpec registry** (`scripts/provider_registry.py`) as the single source of truth for provider metadata.
- **Reliability**: retry backoff jitter (`RETRY_JITTER_FRACTION`), locked + atomic provider-health writes (port of hermes v2.4.0).
- **Security hardening** (SkillSpector findings): narrowly scoped skill triggers, SSRF guard for user-supplied URLs, owner-only cache permissions, `WSP_DISABLE_CACHE`, declared skill permissions, and the privacy disclosures above.

## What changed in 3.1.0

- Add **SerpBase** as the 11th search provider — low-cost Google SERP API with prepaid credits (https://serpbase.dev)
- Explicit/fallback-only by design: NOT in default auto-routing priority. Use `--provider serpbase` or opt-in via `config.json`.
- Closes [#4](https://github.com/robbyczgw-cla/web-search-plus/issues/4); brings skill to parity with `web-search-plus-plugin` v3.0.0

## What changed in 3.0.x

- Add **Brave**, **Linkup**, and **Firecrawl** search providers to the Python skill
- Add **URL extraction** via `scripts/extract.py` with auto fallback across Firecrawl, Linkup, Tavily, Exa, and You.com
- Align routing/fallback behavior and docs more closely with the OpenClaw plugin and Hermes port
- Keep existing **Exa deep** / **deep-reasoning**, cooldown, retry, cache, and SearXNG protections

## Search providers

- **Serper** — shopping, local, broad Google-style web results
- **Brave** — independent general web index, good broad fallback
- **Tavily** — research and explanation queries
- **Querit** — multilingual and international AI search
- **Linkup** — citation/source-grounded search
- **Exa** — semantic discovery with source URLs
- **Firecrawl** — search with scrape-ready metadata
- **You.com** — current-web / RAG-ish queries
- **SearXNG** — privacy-first self-hosted metasearch
- **SerpBase** — low-cost Google SERP, prepaid credits, **explicit/fallback-only**
- **Keenable** — independent web index, keyed or opt-in keyless public tier, lowest priority

## Extraction providers

`scripts/extract.py` supports (auto order, Tavily-first):

- Tavily
- Exa
- Linkup
- Firecrawl
- You.com
- Keenable
- Serper (webpage scraper)

Auto extraction tries them in that order and falls back when a provider is unconfigured or fails. Oversized pages are truncated to a head/tail window (default 15,000 chars, `WSP_EXTRACT_CHAR_LIMIT`); inline base64 images become `[IMAGE: alt]` placeholders.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in at least one key or SEARXNG_INSTANCE_URL

python3 scripts/search.py -q "latest OpenClaw release"
python3 scripts/extract.py --url https://example.com
```

Or use the interactive wizard:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py
```

## Search examples

```bash
python3 scripts/search.py -q "weather in Vienna today"
# auto-routes to Brave or Serper for broad current-web intent

python3 scripts/search.py -q "find credible sources for AI tutoring outcomes"
# auto-routes to Linkup when available

python3 scripts/search.py -q "latest AI policy updates in Germany"
# often Querit / Tavily depending on configured providers

python3 scripts/search.py -p exa --exa-depth deep -q "LLM scaling laws research"
python3 scripts/search.py -p firecrawl -q "YC startups web scraping"
python3 scripts/search.py -p serpbase -q "best laptop 2026"
# explicit SerpBase call — not used by auto-routing unless added to provider_priority
```

## Extraction examples

```bash
python3 scripts/extract.py --url https://example.com
python3 scripts/extract.py --url https://docs.linkup.so --provider linkup
python3 scripts/extract.py --url https://example.com --url https://example.org --include-images
```

## Research mode & quality reports

```bash
# Concurrent multi-provider search + dedup + top-source extraction
python3 scripts/search.py --mode research -q "EU AI Act obligations for foundation models"
python3 scripts/search.py --mode research -q "..." --research-providers tavily linkup exa --research-time-budget 30

# Transparent routing/result diagnostics with authority signals
python3 scripts/search.py -q "official anthropic claude release notes" --quality-report
```

Research providers run concurrently (wall-clock ≈ slowest provider); result ordering stays deterministic by submission order. For canonical-source query classes (vendor releases, official docs, policy PDFs, finance/IR, security advisories) results are reranked so primary sources beat mirrors — see `metadata.intent_rerank` and `quality_report.authority_signals`.

## Caching

Results are cached under `.cache` (override with `WSP_CACHE_DIR`) for up to 1 hour by default; provider failure history lives in `.cache/provider_health.json` and adaptive-routing performance samples in `.cache/provider_stats.json`. The directory is created `0700` and files `0600`.

```bash
python3 scripts/search.py -q "..." --cache-ttl 120  # shorter result-cache lifetime
python3 scripts/search.py -q "..." --no-cache    # bypass for one call
WSP_DISABLE_CACHE=1 python3 scripts/search.py -q "..."   # disable globally
python3 scripts/search.py --clear-cache          # wipe cached results
python3 scripts/search.py --cache-stats          # inspect
```

Query recency and the effective date filter cap the TTL even when `--cache-ttl` requests a longer lifetime. `--time-range` takes precedence over `--freshness`; a shorter explicit TTL still wins. Nonpositive TTL values use the default before applying caps. Cache hits report `cache_age_seconds`. Research mode queries providers directly and does not use the search-result cache.

## Routing notes

Provider priority now defaults to:

```text
tavily -> linkup -> querit -> exa -> firecrawl -> brave -> serper -> you -> searxng
```

Notable behavior:

- Brave and Serper share generic web/current-info intent and use deterministic tie-breaking
- Linkup gets explicit boosts for citation/source/evidence-style queries
- Firecrawl can win discovery/research-ish queries when configured
- Exa can auto-upgrade to `deep` or `deep-reasoning` based on query signals
- Failing or cooling-down providers are skipped by fallback routing

## Config files

- `.env.example` — provider credentials template
- `config.example.json` — routing and provider settings template
- `config.json` — your live local config (created/edited locally)

## Verification

Suggested local checks:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 scripts/search.py --explain-routing -q "find credible sources for climate change impacts"
python3 scripts/extract.py --url https://example.com --provider auto --compact
```
