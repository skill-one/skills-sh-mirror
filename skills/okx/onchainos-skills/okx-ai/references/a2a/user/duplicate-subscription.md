# Duplicate Subscription Guide

Use this guide only when `reason=duplicate_subscription`.

## Input

Require non-empty `payload.jobId` and `payload.title`, plus boolean
`payload.restoreListeningAvailable`. Missing or invalid fields are a hard stop;
never guess the subscription from history or run another task list.

## Routing

- `restoreListeningAvailable=true`: render this pattern in the user's language,
  substituting the payload values. Use exactly:
  `A subscription task for this service already exists. Job ID: <jobId>. Task name: <title>. Another subscription cannot be created. Restore listening?`
  Offer only the returned `nextAction` entries and wait for an explicit choice.
  - `restore_subscription`: retain `payload.jobId` as the explicit current
    subscription and enter `subscription-manage.md` **Signal-receipt watch
    entry**. This restores receiving only. If the User also explicitly asks to
    resume automatic copy-trading on this device, enter
    `restore-copytrade.md` after receipt is restored; never treat
    `restore_subscription` alone as permission to recreate an execution
    contract.
  - `stop`: end the current flow without creating or watching a subscription.
- `restoreListeningAvailable=false`: render this pattern in the user's language,
  substituting the payload values. Use exactly:
  `A subscription task for this service already exists. Job ID: <jobId>. Task name: <title>. Another subscription cannot be created.`
  Do not enter watch; only `stop` is valid.

Do not add a separate `userFacingPrompt` field and do not omit the task name from
the rendered message.
